  # @name - switch active speaker to @name
  # @any - switch active speaker to closest vectorial distance based on tags
  # no @ - active speaker
  # @name + no message - forwards the previous message to @name
  # @all - all proxies in collective in order of vectorial distance
  # << + no message - remove last message
  # >> + no message - regenerate last message
  # <<<< + no message - remove last message pair
  # cognitive process to feed relationships between proxies
  #     "based on the conversation so far, what is your opinion about @name"
  #     triggered when the speaker changes and asked about last speaker
  # decisory statements and other prompts generated within subcontexts should be fed to innerThoughts
  
  # All contexts should be updated
  # The collective can assign its own context to each proxy and manage system prompts on message received
  #     because cogsys prompts are assigned after message received
  # Right now, there's no mechanic in place to allow for two proxies to call each other
  
  # cogProc to assign and update extended core. if there's no extended core, the proxy should check his memory for 
  
  #     but this can be implemented via cogProcess
  # ^^N^^L - shift message up -- useful when asking the opinion of multiple proxies on a subject
  #          N = N messages to shift
  #          L = L lines to shift up
  # vvKvvN - shift message down -- useful when returning to a topic
  #          N = N messages to shift
  #          K = K lines above the last
  #          Messages shifted down always go to the bottom
  # shorter versions like ^^N and vvK can be used as well  
  # authoritative modules that register the class name, the function and the regex pattern for dynamic calling
  #     maybe registered and managed by a new class instead of cogniteveSystem
