He could be relied on to hold down a minimum wage job for a month or two. But then some fine Friday night he'd throw back a few six-packs and start to believe he was the Wrath of God. So he'd drive around until he found a gas station that just pissed him off.\",\n",

Daryll Earl had to schlep out and pick them all up, boring work, no doubt.',\n",
