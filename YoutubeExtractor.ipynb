      "so I think everyone can agree that getting away with murder is a lot easier when you're killing fictional characters in your story now it's no secret that killing your precious protagonist progeny can be difficult costly and necessary in working your book in the direction that you want to go but there's a whole other question that very few stories even attempt to answer how do you kill off your main character your one protagonist spoilers for Vikings and a game of Thrones hid so in the TV show Vikings Ragnar lothbrok gets himself captured and killed in a pit of snakes at the hands of putty mechanic beard an expert misogynist King Eila of Northumbria in a similar fashion needs star gets captured and killed by removal of one's head at the hands of the kid who used to torture ants at school King Joffrey I'm totally a Baratheon but before we can continue we should probably touch on what a protagonist is well he or she is the guy or the girl that for the most part has been the driver of your story either by their decisions or by their importance because of who or what they are so Harry Potter is kind of an example of both he's the focus of the story because of what he is the baby who defeated Voldemort but he's also the protagonist because he makes decisions that drive the plot forward he's the one who says hey you see that dark and mysterious place that we've been warned against going to that's where I want to be there might be other characters making decisions around them but those characters and their roles are often contingent on the existence or the decisions of that protagonist George RR Martin's need Stark is a great example of this there are other main characters around him at the start of the story Sansa Arya brand John even Rob Boyd eats people like to breed but even though they have their own chapters their own storylines much of their role is defined at least at the beginning by the decisions of their father and it's stuck the protagonist Sansa is made to marry Joffrey robbers made to be the Lord of Winterfell Arya is allowed to train with Syrio and bran is mostly having a great time visiting coma build the direction and the focus of the story is also driven by Ned Stark the major revelations of the mystery at the heart of the story are made by him and him alone and the crucial decisions in the story are made by him to go south to become the hand of the king to confront Joffrey after the death of Robert and to threaten Cersei Lannister now books particularly young adult literature are rife with characters like these Harry tetanus Beatrice Clary but not Bella from Twilight because she never actually makes a consequential decision throughout the entire story the story sort of just happens to her though she is an example of the second type of protagonists who are the protagonist because of who or what they are but the point is is that very few major developments happen in the story without them being present and you can actually have multiple protagonists but for the sake of this essay I'll be referring to them as the one lead character killing your protagonists can feel like the whole story is kind of thrown into disarray the readers will cry out what but somebody has to wear the invulnerable plot armor because killing your protagonist creates what feels like a myriad of problems how do you continue a story when the CEO of your character board is gone when you don't have the character that your audience has been rooting for most of the time it's difficult for the audience to continue being invested in your story when the consequences and the triumphs of a story thus far can be largely attributed to that particular character because of those very few stories actually kill their protagonists or those that do don't tend to do so until the end so that they don't have to face the consequences for most writers this situation is terrifying but in Vikings and for our resident authorial monster george RR martin who i will now refer to only as ger this was intentional where a lot of authors try to minimize these questions that spring up in the wake of their death as if to hope that their readers do not notice the difference between one Ragnar lothbrok and no Ragnar lothbrok these two stories revel in the loss of their protagonist the event that disturbs the life of a protagonist and sets their story in motion is known as the inciting incident it often presents a problem that needs to be solved or puts them in a situation that requires them to act or adapt in a game of Thrones the inciting incident for the story was the death of Jon Arryn it motivated needs start to go south but arguably it's actually the death of Ned Stark that is the inciting incident for these stories of these seven or so books following it acts as the inciting incident for Sansa story Arya story as well as Robb and Catelyn in a similar fashion Ragnar death is the inciting incident for the arrival of the Great heathen army for the war between uber sir Geneva and the war between King Harold and lagertha exploring the consequences of your protagonists dying can not only be really interesting but is essential to maintaining the realism of the story using their death as an inciting incident gives the character a presence in the story even after they're gone and it helps bridge the gap between having the character and not having them in the story now of course with your protag looking the boots of Death himself sometimes it can feel like you need to have someone new or a previously established character step up into the role of their previous protagonists to fill the awkwardly shaped boots per se but neither of these stories even attempt to do that no the agency of the story doesn't shift from one character to another character but it divests into half a dozen other characters now this doesn't mean that killing your protagonists requires hordes of characters like in a game of Thrones but it does make it easier actually Vikings has a relatively small cast in comparison now one of the reasons that this worked is that people often find it hard to accept new characters filling the roles of a character their lifts or died when John Doggett essentially replaced Fox Mulder in the x-files as male lead who had a family member abducted but not that kind of abduct is the fans weren't well fans no matter how different the writers tried to make these two characters it still felt incredibly wrong I mean it will very easily turn into your readers screaming you're not my real dad and the new protagonist but I want to be clear this isn't an absolute rule when it comes to writing in the comic book world it's extremely common for characters to take up the mantle of superheroes before them and it often works while he we're succeeding Barry Allen as the flash is just one example but there's a good in world reason for that the whole taking up the mantle thing works in the comic book scenario because it's integral to the theme of anyone can be a superhero there could be you you or you it doesn't feel like the writer is forcing you to accept someone pretending to be the other protagonists that came before them readers are pedantic but loyal creatures and it can still be hard to persuade them to accept these new characters so it's not a perfect formula Connor Hawke successfully replaced Oliver Queen as the Green Arrow but there was still a marker decline in interest in the series after Queens death but killing your protagonist isn't just a matter of exploring the consequences and the follow-through after they die it's also about how you setup their death as well because generally speaking there's a relatively and I say relatively because there are plenty of exceptions reliable formula for making your readers cry the more time you spend with someone as a character the more tears you get when they die and there's nothing wrong with wanting to make your protagonists death a big moment but making it so that the entire story leads up to their death that every plot thread that you write facilitators and the story effectively revolves around their role it presents a very particular problem when the death of your main character and its consequences are the payoff for the whole story before it readers are sometimes left asking well what is there left for me to care about you spent all this time leading up to this moment and what else trauma Vikings got around this problem pretty cleverly up in a clever way whatever as the story evolved one of the other main characters beyond his story of becoming an adventurer became independent of Ragnar lothbrok as the protagonist and we were beginning to explore it well before Ragnar death likewise we became invested in legatus story without it requiring Ragnar and while either 'Ã¼ber hvitserk and Sigurd stories were all contingent on the death of Ragnar the show spent a good deal of time beforehand shifting the focus to their feud with lega and the rivalries between them as brothers that set the stage for the remainder of the series in fact in the half season leading up to regognize death the agency of the series began to shift away from him and into the hands of the other characters now often enough a main character's death is portrayed as a self-made fate where every event that leads up to it is directly or indirectly controlled by that main character but in Vikings the characters who drive the direction of the show at that point are clearly either uber hvitserk Sigurd beyond like a thick bird not Ragnar the writers made it so that by the time of Ragnar steer the viewer already feels that the agency of the show is very much in the hands of characters who will continue it doesn't feel like a reboot time has been spent investing and storylines that are not contingent on Ragnar's role as the protagonist you calcula say that this actually from moves ragnar from the position of protagonist another good example of this technique was the Mentalist the story spent its entire first six seasons building up to things james rivalry with Red John and Jane's relationship with Elizabeth but after the death of Red John the show didn't actually drop from it's 12 million or so viewers per episode part of the reason for this I think is that the story was not wholly contingent on that rivalry with Red John it was dependent on the development of that relationship as well in a game of Thrones there were storylines that weren't contingent on Ned Stark's role as the protagonist most prominently with Daenerys and John's storylines in fact at the end of the first book when John decides to abandon the Nights Watch in defense of the Starks he's stopped and continues with his storyline as if Gurr himself as saying no not every story has to be contingent on your protagonist a smaller but more important detail I think and Vikings is that Ragnar died in episode 15 of 24 not at the end of the season killing the protagonist partway through your book immediately surfers expectations in the Game of Thrones book need stark dies with over 100 pages still to go killing a protagonist at the end of a series or a book gives it a sense of finality while killing them halfway through reinforces to the reader that there is still story to follow and explore so killing your main character is a complex difficult fun and risky thing to do using it as the inciting incident to other stories is a great idea except when it isn't and trying to have someone fill the oversized shoes of your protagonist is nearly always going to go badly except when it won't and it's not just about the consequences but more importantly the set up moving agency of the story two other characters before their deaths can be a really effective way of preparing the reader for that deal but that's all from me reading and writing that kind of a big thing for me I've loved you know reading books and writing stories and studying stories for pretty much my entire life I like studying narratives how people structure it develop it and why some books are good or famous and why some aren't let me know if you've found any of this helpful and whether you'd like me to do more of this kind of thing in the future and if so what would you like me to talk about in 2018 I want to evolve my channel to not just include law and nerdy stuff but arguably talk about my greatest passion storytelling I'm just some guy on the Internet of course but I wish you

      "mr. Fury's question time what do Norse mythology Sherlock and Hot Fuzz all have in common well one thing is a final battle where you have the final confrontation of your hero and your villain you get to kill a few characters and you get to make your readers cry final battles appear in almost every story in some shape or form but the question we'll be talking about today is what makes for a good final battle though before we can get to that we should probably define just what a final battle is it may call to mind images of the forces of good all dressed in shiny armor clashing with the Bulaga toriel clad and black bad guys but final battles appear across multiple genres most prominently in fantasy and science fiction but also in action thriller mystery and plenty of others simply put the final battle takes place at the climax of the story pitting your protagonists against the antagonists in some combative form with the consequences of said battle determining the outcome of your story though we'll be talking more about the science fiction/fantasy side of this a final battle also may or may not include the following when considering ways to write a final battle it's somewhat comes down to what we'll call primary and secondary conflicts we'll discuss what they mean how to use them and how to subvert them and we'll also be talking a lot about lot of the rings which is always a fantastic thing to do so primary and secondary conflicts here's a challenge for you next time you're reading or watching a final battle if you were to phrase that confrontation between the protagonists and antagonists and a single question what would that be now I love swords hitting shields space lasers and wizards doing things as much as the next guy but the question is almost never simply asking who is better with a sword or who can fly a spaceship better the final battle in parts of the Caribbean isn't asking whether Jack Sparrow can out saudade Jones it's asking whether Jack has changed and becomes self sacrificial enough to defeat Davy Jones by taking his place on the Flying Dutchman in the Avengers it's not so much asking whether Iron Man or Loki are stronger but whether the Avengers can use the power of teamwork needed to defeat Loki because everyone knows that nothing beats the power of friendship and these questions are at the heart of the difference between primary and secondary conflicts the secondary conflict is usually the visual confrontation between your protagonists and antagonists the who is better with a sword question while the primary conflict is the internal battle closely related to character or theme involving a struggle change within characters that helps determine the outcome of the final battle the Lord of the Rings The Return of the King is perhaps my favorite example of this at the climax of the story Aragorn leads an army against Sauron and the Black Gate this is a secondary conflict at the same time Frodo Sam and Gollum come to their final confrontation and Mount Doom the secondary conflict is being fought at the Black Gate but the tension of the final battle comes almost entirely from the primary conflict at Mount Doom where the reader is questioning whether Frodo is strong enough to resist the one ring after all this time the answer to this question is integral to the themes of the story and photos character arc and it's the primary conflict end Mount Doom that ultimately determines the outcome of the secondary conflict with Aragorn at the Black Gate and there's a good reason that this works the final battle is the culmination of all of the elements of your story having both a primary and a secondary conflict ties your climax to character development giving the final battle emotional weight by changing the state your characters are in as well as giving it a narrative weight by changing the state your world is in it also allows the Raider to empathize with the characters more by using relatable character struggles in the climax as well as spectacle because how many of us have ever had to defend ourselves in a sword fight before but the question remains how do you write these conflicts to fit together in a cohesive and persuasive piece of writing firstly the primary conflict a character faces during the final battle cannot come out of nowhere there's a reason it's less compelling when the hero refuses to kill the villain because but they never had any trouble slaughtering hundreds of his henchmen why should they care about a character struggle that was never there before hand it feels disconnected from the rest of the story and makes for a relatively hollow character choice readers care about choices that are difficult or important to the character but that importance comes from spending time exploring the nuances of that decision beforehand just as the events of the plot lead up to the final battle the arc of the character should lead up to their primary conflict in Terry Pratchett's novel the fifth elephant the reader cares when Sam Vimes has to kill someone in the line of duty because it has been explored why he doesn't like to beforehand so where does this primary conflict come from in John troubies book the anatomy of a story he details three important elements to designing characters a weakness a psychological need and a moral need a weakness is simply a character flaw a psychological need is something that only effects the hero and must be fulfilled within themselves for them to live a bitter life while a moral need is something that affixed those around them and must be changed within themselves for them to live a better life for example in the last airbender Aang's weakness is that he attempts to avoid problems rather than face them because of this his psychological need is to overcome his past and let go of his guilt while his moral need is to stop being so passive when faced with challenges because he's letting those around him get hurt and die it's these three elements of a character that connect to the beginning of the story with the final battle weaknesses psychological needs and moral needs create multi-dimensional characters and using them in your primary conflicts creates a multi-dimensional final battle which is always far more interesting a character overcoming their internal struggles results in what Truby terms the moment of self revelation this revelation should be psychological or moral or both depending on what kind of needs you established your character to have previously one way to write to this moment of self revelation into your final battle is rather than have your character turn around and preach to the reader well now I understand the true power of friendship have them take a new course of action that they could not have taken before you can see this trope in stories all over the place in Shakespeare's Hamlet it's only in his moment of self revelation that Hamlet overcomes his depression and indecisiveness his psychological need and in doing so he can finally confront the man that killed his father which he could not bring himself to do before a self-revelation that leads a character to take a new course of action when the tension is low means less because there is less at stake for them while a self-revelation that leads to a new course of action when the tension is high feels like a more convincing character change because there is more for them to gain or lose and it's at the final battle that the story reaches its highest point of tension now while it's common for protagonists to succeed in both their primary and secondary conflicts this isn't always necessary and subverting this model can lead to some really interesting moments in a story in The Return of the Jedi the audience is led to believe that the lightsaber duel between Luke and Darth Vader is where it has all been leading to this duel is a secondary or visual conflict but the whole spectacle is subvert it when Luke bests Vader but is defeated by the impure anyway suddenly the fact that Luke is a better duelist doesn't and it's here that the true primary conflict comes into play whether Vader will choose the Emperor or his family and it's the struggle that decides the outcome of the final battle not the lightsaber duel that we were all led to believe the fact that Vader doesn't even use a lightsaber when turning on the Emperor emphasizes the important themes of their being good and everyone and that family and loyalty can change the world more than violence ever could now fantasy and sci-fi have a tendency to rely on a trope where one hero is largely responsible for the defeat of the antagonist and there's nothing intrinsically wrong with that having a story focused on one individual can be done well but if you want to write a final battle that stays away from this trope having a protagonist lose their secondary conflict in the final battle is one way to do it it creates an unexpected moment of tension in danger for the reader as well as easily allowing for the involvement of other heroes in the defeat of your antagonist because your protagonist needs them and can't do it themselves who doesn't need the power of friendship though an important side note is that there's usually more than one primary conflict at played during the final battle Luke having to resist the dark side Vader having to choose between family and Emperor and the TIE fighter pilots questioning whether the good guys are really the ones with the space laser called The Death Star are we the baddie but there are other interesting ways to use primary and secondary conflicts let's be honest the evil guys always have cooler outfits and what better reason could there be for an author to want a character to turn having the character succeed in this secondary conflict but only at the cost of them losing the primary conflict can be an effective way to do this it gives real consequences to a character flaw and allows the readers to see the character in a radically different environment to where they were before which can be far more interesting than simply referencing a weakness without deeply exploring its consequences avatar the last airbender Zuko is a great example while definitely more of a grey character than strictly evil in season 2 Zuko helps beat team avatar conquers Ba Sing se and returns home victorious but he did so at the cost of giving in to his anger and betraying the one person who truly loves him his uncle for the obvious reason this usually doesn't happen at the climactic final battle it would be a bit disappointing to have your hero get to the end and say you know what the evil guys do have been outfits the end instead this tends to happen partway through the story the obvious exception to this are stories about fallen heroes the Godfather is the story of a man who had the final battle beats his enemies but does so at the cost of him becoming the very thing he used to hate winning his secondary conflict but losing his primary he became a fallen hero on a different level final battles are by nature meant to be final right well not to some authors in fact a lot of authors there's an incredibly common subversion of the final battle that plenty of authors use how many times have you read a book where the heroes take down the villain and save the day only to return home and find that the villain is making one last ditch effort to hurt them or someone they love seriously how common this trope is it took me ages to think of examples in the Lord of the Rings destroying the ring and Mount Doom isn't actually the end of the story in the book that may have been the final battle but the hobbits return home and find Saruman has taken over and destroyed the Shire their home in the very thing they were fighting to protect all along likewise in The Incredibles you'll remember that Syndrome is defeated in a big final battle in this city but he then turns up at their home threatening to kill Jack Jack while the final battle is typically over the grander goals or plans of the antagonists to this one last stand tends to be an attempt to hurt the heroes more personally The Last Stand can be a powerful moment for the author to put the protagonists in their most vulnerable position and reveal what the stakes truly are usually the villain fails in their last-ditch effort to hurt the hero but on the rare occasion that they succeed it can make for a truly poignant ending to a story that despite winning the final battle they couldn't protect what they care about most if that's what you want to say thematically then that's up to you you pessimists in a sense Doctor Who episode Ginny is sort of an example of this the doctor saves the day but the villain makes one last stand and a person dear to the doctor his daughter sort of died anyway hashtag bring back Jenny so how much you write your final battle firstly giving it primary and secondary conflicts makes for a multi-dimensional climax to your story secondly this primary conflict should arise out of the moral or psychological needs that have been explored throughout the story beforehand thirdly this should manifest in them taking a new course of action that they could not do beforehand and fourthly there are plenty of ways to subvert the final battle that make for an interesting or unique story whether you use these is simply after you and depends on the kind of story you want to write that's all from me

      "beneath this mask there is more than flesh beneath this mask there is an idea mr. greedy haisa pure is a V for Vendetta directed by James McTeague is one of those rare films that relies on historical allusions symbols and philosophy in each and every one of its moments the film culminates with a revolution against the tyrannical Norse fire regime people marching in the streets and the houses of parliament being razed to the ground but Alan Moore's story offers a more complex question about politics the people and power winners revolution truly justified what justifies the power of the government and when can you the individual take up arms against them from the first scene of the film we see the dictatorial framework of Chancellor sellers Britain after a history of biological disaster warfare starvation and drought a new society arose and where once you had the freedom to objective different Incans because you saw fit you now have censors and systems of surveillance coercing your conformity and there are civilian curfews extreme search and seizure methods and surveillance at every level of society we're describing how chanceless Atlas regime justified these extreme measures of power and the first act VIII explains here I got the best year and in your panic you turned to the now High Chancellor Adam sutler he paused you father he promised you peace and all he demanded in return was your silent obedient consent the wording here is purposeful McTigue chose the twin ideas of fear and consent to recall the philosophy of Thomas Hobbes a 17th century political philosopher to put it extremely simply in his famous work Leviathan Hobbes talked about what justifies government power he argued two things firstly that government power is justified by consent you have to consent to your government having power of you secondly that it is human nature to fear death above all else he believes that if you do not have a government not even your life can be guaranteed against those around you because humans will event kill each other for resources land or wife and if we're so focused on staying alive and afraid of those around us then freedom of speech religion action and assembly are simply not guaranteed or even possible v alludes to the sentiment in his revolutionary speech I know why you did it I know you were afraid who wouldn't be war terror disease there were a myriad probably conspired to corrupt your reason and rob you of your common sense imagine a classroom without a teacher johnny has three pencils and knows Mikey will not take them because the teacher would punish Mikey if he tried to but if the teacher leaves then nothing is to stop Mikey from beating Johnny up and taking his pencil if he needs it a classroom without a teacher is like living without government to Hobbes any calls such a situation the state of nature if this is one it's like without government then we can see how sutlers norse fire regime justifies its power any government that can provide peace order stability and relieve us of that constant fear for our lives must be necessarily bitter than the state of nature no matter how oppressive it may be under this philosophy sutlers government is justified because a that people voted him into power and be his regime brought people out of the state of nature by relieving them of that constant fear of death - Hobbes these are the only two requirements fundamentally fear of death is the governing principle of human action in Hobbes its philosophy when considering these eventual revolution in this light if the idea of having no state means falling into such utter chaos that one is terrified for their life that they cannot have meaningful relationships that they're in a constant state of war then no such revolution is v's can ever be justified Chancellor sutler says as much doubt will plunge this country back into chaos and I will not let that happen to him the risk is too high no matter what liberties V fights for sunnahs government is supposedly legitimate because it provides for the most base human concern security of life where the state of nature can but V for Vendetta directly challenges the assumptions underpinning this model of political legitimacy McTigue challenges the idea that fear has to be the governing principle of human nature after evey steps and to save thee at the BTW and she begins to panic and questions why she did so you did what you thought was right in my mind what you really think in the scene evey acted on instinct or human nature but she didn't take the cause of action that would be motivated by fear of death after all attacking a cop could get her killed she instead took action for a reason she can't quite specify it is here that the film first offers that something other than fear of death can be closer to the heart of human nature in the rest of the movie centers largely around eby's transition from fearful to fearless you said you wanted to live without fear the film reaches its climax when the populace goes through much the same transformation as evey from fearful to fearless faced with armed men they march on Parliament and hopes of pursuing something more fundamental than just their life this being the case motika offers the audience a question what is left to justify the government's power the government supposedly becomes legitimate because it can ensure the protection of the most base and instinctual human concern the thing at the bottom of the pyramid that all of the things on top of it rely on Hobbes thought that this was security of life but the film posits that people can put liberal rights in ideas before self-preservation if this is so then sulles regime no longer protects the most fundamental principle and the high Chancellor's Authority lacks basis the bottom of the pyramid is lost and all the rest with it under this model of thought these revolution becomes justified because the state of nature has become preferable to having the state this is because fear of death is no longer the governing principle of human action it is liberty there is the opportunity for freedom of speech freedom of action freedom of religion in the state of nature even if there is no longer order protection of life but that doesn't matter because these liberal ideas have replaced - security of life at the bottom of the pyramid but these revolution is still not wholly justified because we're left with a bit of an odd situation of whether things like freedom of speech and action are protected by the government can determine when a revolution becomes justified and what point does this rights of revolution truly kick in can you the ordinary citizen for example start blowing up the Empire State Building because you don't believe the government has the right to give you a parking ticket I mean it depends on the parking no no but really the obvious issue is that if we let every individual person in society decide whether the government is acting legitimately then it'll lead to an unending series of tiny rebellions and social instability and we're back to square one it is in the third act of the movie that V directly addresses this philosophical issue and it's really going to happen as did it wanted to and the truth is you made me understand that I was wrong that the choices to pull this lever is not mine to make tomorrow a different world will begin that different people will shape this choice is belongs to them throughout the movie we come to see that v is not just motivated by the Justice and these higher ideas that he talks about but by anger and revenge against those who wronged him in Pauline Myers study from resistance to revolution she wrote private individuals were forbidden to take force against their rulers because of private injuries not just a few individuals but the body of the people had to feel concerned before the right of revolution was justified indicating a broad consensus involving all ranks of society v acknowledges that merely personal grievances against the Norse fire regime do not justify revolution galvanizing the population was originally a practical thing for the success of his plan but it later became clear it was also what gave a legitimacy evey Hammond being the representative of the British public undergoing a change of heart at the same time she was had to be the one to pull the lever a symbolic act that changed raising Parliament to the ground from a personal terrorist act of v's grievance to a principled and justified revolution it is a collective right not an individual so if you're planning to overthrow your government how do you justify a revolution Viva vendetta asserts that it is not human nature to place fear of death above all else but that humans are capable of desiring personal integrity and liberty more if these things are more important to us than self-preservation a government that protects the latter but not the former becomes illegitimate this is because life in the state of nature without a government has become preferable to that with the government however this is not an individual right to rebel but a collective one they requires the people to prefer it with some consensus these revolution was one not one on any bail field but in the hearts of men a legitimate revolution requires each and every individual to say viva la live in a few well that was something that I've wanted to do for a long time and after I made my first video essay on Zaheer's philosophy from Avatar and fear more fair please go check it out I had such a really positive response like all the comments that we just made me so happy so I really wanted to make another one even though it terrifies me when I make these because I'm always afraid I'm get it horribly wrong but if you enjoyed a place to put me with the like and let me know what you thought on the essay down in the comments below so V is traditionally renowned as the paragon of the chaotic good character so my question for you today is what alignment are you lawful good chaotic evil true neutral let me know down in the comments below if this video looks a little bit weirdest because it is my very very first time ever using my new GoPro I figured that now that I have like 61 62 thousand subscribers and I've made over 140 videos it was about time for me to stop using the $150 camera and get me something a little bit bitter I got a new camera a new tripod and I use this new microphone and I've been teaching myself how to use audio editing software so hopefully this video sounded better than my previous one wave of India has always held a special place in cinematic history for me not because the story of it is particularly unique you know the idea of a masked man going on a vengeful justified quest against a tyrannical government or whatever isn't a particularly new one but it is full of meaning and symbols and philosophy and as someone who loves analyzing and learning about that sort of thing it holds a special place in my heart in the meantime if you like my work please consider supporting me on patreon and then come follow me on Twitter Wattpad Facebook email me stuff you've made I'll see my stuff mini-dress and links in the description below stay nerdy sub furies and i'll see you in the future\n",

      "hey Severus ah the chosen one alongside magical swords did parents and terrible movie adaptions this is one of fantasy and sci-fi favorite storytelling sharps which also means that people have strong feelings about whether or not you should use it I mean it's not uncommon to hear hey I was thinking of writing a chosen one you are dead to me but there is a world of difference between a trope that negatively impacts writing by its mere existence and one that just feels overused still feels unimaginative so today we'll be talking about what makes them work and what makes them not work but in particular I want to talk about some less common things that writers might think about will be breaking this down into four parts supporting characters destiny quests character development and narrative structure also I'm really happy to say that today's video is sponsored by Verve so Verve is a place with 12 amazing channels with the best anime animation gaming comedy fantasy and

the description below for a 30-day ed free trial so chosen ones and supporting characters one of the underestimated effects of having a chosen one in your story is its effect on the place of your supporting characters chosen ones naturally create a central point of tension in the narrative that they're the only ones who can defeat the Dark Lord we're the MacGuffin of power or inherit the throne deciding where the story is headed and who gets in the way but that point of tension is usually focused around one character otherwise known as the chosen one and that's all well and good but it can leave the supporting characters with what feels like a minimal role or one that's just reduced to them being the main characters backup dancers if the chosen one is the only person in the world who can resolve the central point of tension in the story then the supporting characters can feel isolated from the climax to the reader it can feel like they have no agency that it doesn't matter whether they're there or not because ultimately if they aren't the chosen one then they can't play a consequential role this is largely because the dramatic thread of the story has been built around the chosen ones destiny whatever it may be so how do you involve supporting characters in the tension of a chosen ones story one of the best ways is to give each supporting character their own dramatic threat that builds a side.the chosen once in the narrative my favorite example of this is guess what Avatar The Last Airbender the godsend of storytelling so the avatar is the chosen one the only person who can defeat the Fire Lord but the climax doesn't just revolve around that battle the supporting characters in the story Zuko Katara Toph and Sokka each have their own battles to fight completely separate from any force of destiny that guides the battle between the avatar in the Fire Lord brother-sister tensions are built to a climax when Katara and Zuko take on Azula and soccers leadership is tested when they take on the battle fleet more importantly the story spent way more time emphasizing the tension between Zuko and Azula than it ever did the tension between the avatar and the Fire Lord meaning was actually that battle completely unrelated to the chosen one that felt more tense for the viewers at the climax by building complex around supporting characters earlier in the narrative that don't arise from the chosen this element not only does this give supporting characters integral roles to play in the climax but it supports the agency of all characters these threads can relate to the chosen one but shouldn't be dependent on it with this the reader is left feeling that the story couldn't have been concluded without them this is because even if the chosen one fulfills their destiny a large part of the tension that has been built throughout the story hasn't been satisfactorily resolved now one way that authors put a twist on this is not to have one chosen character but many chosen characters heroes of olympus by rick riordan is one example of this where each of the main characters play a role in the prophecy you could even go full old testament and do the whole chosen people or daar that up even higher again and have a chosen one within their chosen people secondly destiny quests when used well the forces of fate and destiny can create interesting challenges for characters but the difficult thing is well doing that right so the trend of chosen ones stories has been that whatever the chosen one has to do it must be a good thing because destiny and who could possibly have a problem with destiny right and even if their destiny isn't entirely predictable or maybe it has a prophecy that says someone will die the characters still tend to agree that fulfilling that prophecy is a good thing except for the bad guys because it you know usually ends up and then dying now this set up isn't inherently thing but it's often criticized because it doesn't necessarily add anything to the narrative instead it can undermine dramatic tension by making it so that when the heroes do succeed the reader doesn't feel it's entirely because the characters fought for it but because chosen one or it can have the unintended effect of making the story morally simple that one outcome must be good and the other outcome must be bad just because they're the chosen one the CNF can come across as stale and predictable to readers so let's talk about two interesting ways to distinguish the chosen ones story from this common setup one way is to have them chosen for something that they actively want to stop and this trope goes way back like to the Greek story of Oedipus and Beyond but my favorite example of this is supernatural or as I like to call it love conquers all but I swear were not gay we're the two main characters Dean and Sam turn out to be the chosen ones distant to help bring the apocalypse which neither of them want for the obvious reason that they sort of have a thing for being alive in existing on top of that one of them is destined to be the villain during it and the other the hero sort of and in the lead-up to all of this they actively talked about how they were struggling with the idea that if destiny was a thing then nothing they'd ever decided really mattered it was a heartbreaking but beautiful moment when they managed to stop half of it coming true having the chosen ones actively opposed their chosen Ness complicates that central point of tension it can add layers to the narrative facilitating an interesting thematic exploration of free will beyond that instead of weakening the dramatic tension it adds to it by forcing them to fight against something that feels unstoppable destiny either heightening that sense of achievement if they manage to avoid it or making the emotional impact heavier if they follow it on a side note this sometimes manifests in the whole you can avoid destiny storyline which riders commonly handled by having the destiny come true just not in the way that the characters or the readers expect this is usually to do with a prophecy chosen one and while it does add a mystery thread to the narrative it can yet feel stale because it often a still makes the story morally simple and be still under my instrument attention by making the protagonists achievements feel less their own if you really want to set your story apart from this comment setup it may be more interesting to ask other questions what's the fallout from avoiding destiny what are the consequences maybe the prophecy will change in response or it'll pick a new chosen one or fate will turn against the good guys entirely and in the very rare case the whole you can avoid Destiny's story can appear in the antagonist selfs being the chosen one which makes it absolute hell for the main characters to defeat them because who can control destiny this is what happened in Spyro dawn of the Dragon where metaphor was the chosen purple dragon destined to destroy the world and he actually succeeded for a little bit a second way to make the destiny threat more interesting is to have a destiny that isn't inherently good or bad this allows the author to give characters different perspectives on the chosen one to draw tension not from merely asking whether they can succeed and stopping or fulfilling their destiny but asking whether their destiny should be fulfilled whether there are more pressing concerns or whether the methods required to follow their destiny are even justified no I don't think I've ever seen this idea fully explored before but the closest that I could find to it is George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire in that story there are a bunch of chosen ones all chosen for different things and not only does Cersei think that there are more pressing concerns for her to think about but tensions rise between Davos and Melisandre over whether the methods by which the prophecy can be fulfilled are justified or even moral and Rhaegar may have thought that in order to fulfill it he had to cheat on his wife marry or kidnap a particular girl and plunge the entire continent into civil war the story isn't predictable in the tensions never lost for the reader because the question of whether the chosen one will fulfill their destiny is just one of many dramatic threads around the whole concept likewise the Matrix subverts the whole chosen one idea in a really interesting way there turns out that there have been many chosen ones in the past before neo but while fulfilling each of their destinies might save lives it probably means sacrificing the last free city of humans not only did other characters within the story disagree on the value of fulfilling it but the chosen ones themselves disagreed giving a chosen one a morally ambiguous fate removes that central point of tension from asking simply whether the Harris will succeed in stopping all fulfilling it which the reader knows that the heroes generally will rather the central point of tension arises from the philosophical in character conflicts around the idea of the destiny itself this alone can make for a fascinating character driven chosen one's story and it allows the narrative to avoid binary depictions of morality like good versus evil thirdly character development and narrative structure and I'm going to talk about these two things together because they're sort of intrinsically linked because conversely having a chosen one means that writers can run the risk of undermining character motivation and the ability of the reader to empathize with that character this is the cosmic was as a fate don't always care about what's going on in the world when picking the chosen one meaning it can come across as cheap of the only reason that this mysterious farm boy you were the 110% dead parents is the only one who has the ability to stop the Dark Lord is because chosen one all that the only reason that main character begins the quest is because chosen one the problem with this narrative Lee is that it reduces your protagonists to a placeholder character the reader can feel that the characters actions have nothing to do with who they are as an individual and this is likewise if the relationships they have with the antagonist and supporting characters have little to do with who they are as people and everything to do with their chosen Ness it makes them unrelatable to the reader because people don't just do things the reader can't empathize with their journey if it isn't motivated in a way that they can understand I mean none of us are chosen once or maybe you are don't let me tell the cosmic space words it's who to pick I said cuz of this it's important to give the chosen one character arcs and motivation outside their chosen this sometimes this can be as simple as defending their loved ones but it can also be far more complex than that a great example of this is in teary precious the color of magic where the main character rincewind doesn't run away to prevent one of the most powerful spells on the universe from falling into the hands of the Rocky Horror Picture Show but because he was a coward and a really bad wizard who could never hold his own anyway in the way that his relationship with to flower the supporting character develops also has nothing to do with his chosen Asst another example is Katniss in The Hunger Games who is sort of a chosen one to lead the rebellion but she doesn't do what she does just because chosen one but because she wants to escape it all because she wants revenge on President Snow and she doesn't really grow into the role she pretends to be someone she's not for the sake of the rebellion multiple elements of motivation make the chosen one more realistic and allow the writer to create interesting struggles with a chosen one's personal motivation conflicts with their motivation to do their duty but when considering character development even more so with chosen ones it's important to consider narrative structure the first act of a story is where the author indicates to the radar the most important desires relationships and points of development for a character meaning this is where the setup is most crucial this is why character conflicts and unplanned sequels often feel jarring because the author never indicated this struggle was of any importance in the first act chosen when stories can feel like any character motivation or choices are being weakened by or at worst being substituted for arbitrary decisions of the universe this makes them less relatable it's important to establish the character as a person apart from their chosen Asst and this needs to be within the first act why is the character doing what they do and why do they have certain kinds of relationships with other characters treat them as people first and chosen one second in the same way it can be hard for a reader to empathize with their whole character development if it's entirely centered around the cosmic forces of destiny instead it's far more interesting when the narrative sets up struggles and character acts for the chosen one that aren't dependent on their chosen Asst a particularly common way is for the story to treat the destiny thread as a subplot often emphasizing the struggles that come from being the chosen one while trying to maintain some semblance of a normal life one example of this is from jake long american dragon where most of the drama in the series came from him trying to be a normal kid facing school drama pursuing his love interest and making his mom happy despite being the chosen one his character development is largely about maturing and becoming less impulsive and arrogant giving the chosen ones struggles that don't rely on their chosen this human eyeses them to the reader but as before this relatable point of conflict needs to be set up in the first act not only does this give the arc more time to develop but it immediately sets up a more relatable dramatic thread that the reader can't know if they'll be able to overcome but we need to talk about special powers because how chosen are you really if you don't have flashy powers to show for it it's important to note that it comes across as a weak writing if the only reason that the chosen one develops such powerful abilities isn't because they worked for it but because the cosmic space was a student said chosen one and this applies the same if they just get it dramatically easier than everyone else even if they don't get it with a click of their fingers an absolutely fantastic subversion of this actually comes from a game the Elder Scrolls 3 morrowind where you think that you're the chosen one and people certainly tell you that you are but the trials that you had to go through to master the abilities you hold could have been done by well anyone they were just incredibly difficult and you happened to be the first person to do it successfully by the end of the story you realize that there isn't any meaningful distinction between you being special and you working for it even if they're the chosen one it's important to make sure the reader feels they've worked for their powers only then can it feel like an achievement when they muster the ability whatever it is but none of this means that they shouldn't have any character acts or struggles related to their chosen Asst the most common story thread around chosen Monza's for them to doubt that they can accomplish what their destined to do this is one of the reasons that Eragon from the Lord of the Rings movie was far more interesting than the one from the books they played up his self-doubt around whether he was ready to ascend to the throne and wield the sword and rule but this particular storyline is so common that it really falls into that overused and unimaginative group so if you really want to distinguish your chosen ones story you might want to find a different character struggle to focus on maybe the chosen one believes it's entirely fictional like in The Chronicles of Thomas covenant where the main character goes out of his way to pretend the world he's mean to say doesn't even exist an interesting subversion of the usual chosen one paradigm is in Lois Lowry's The Giver where being the chosen one doesn't make others look up to or in Maya Jonas he actually finds it difficult because it results in his friends distancing themselves from him and he begins to wonder if it's even worth being the chosen one taking this even a step further others can't become jealous of the characters chosen this because they don't feel that that character earned the respect position or powers they got in tokens the Lord of the Rings Boromir turns on Frodo thinking he's more worthy and responsible that he's the only one who can wield the Rings power appropriately to save the world and well we know how that turned out in some cases especially where a character is chosen by a weapon or an object being the chosen one requires certain character qualities in The Dresden Files the sword of faith only responds to those who are guess what faithful but it also requires the wielder to never break a promise while they're using it creating a continuing struggle for the chosen one character tests are a useful way to frame the personal development of the chosen one as a character has to grow to meet the character requirements or even further they struggled to remain the way that the chosen one is required to be there are any number of personal conflicts that can arise from being the chosen one and whichever you choose is really just up to how you want to write your story but fundamentally the main thing that every writer needs to ask themselves about having a chosen one is what does it add to the story for all the reasons that we've discussed while chosen one's stories can be played in interesting ways there are a few more pitfalls to the stroke than most if the themes are no less nuanced if a character is made more interesting if overcoming their struggles feel more like an achievement and their motivation is more sincere with them not being a chosen one then chances are the story would work better without it there are a lot of chosen ones stories a lot of good ones and a lot of not so good ones I've been lucky to have Verve sponsor this video and if you want to watch a chosen one series that avoids the pitfalls we've talked about in this video then i recommend ruby you can watch it by clicking this link down in the description below for a 30-day free trial completely ad free while i won't spoil the story Ruby Rose is a lineage chosen one meaning she comes from a long line of chosen ones before her but the story works because it gives it supporting characters their own dramatic threads and it ensures that Ruby's motivation her character arcs and relationships are each established apart from her role as the chosen one and it's all within the first act it doesn't feel like the cosmic space was as it just saying chosen one so Verve is this cool streaming service that combines crunchyroll roosterteeth Funimation and a bunch of other great channels dozens of shows subtend of 1080p like a

of this remember Ruby and Full Metal Alchemist so what have we discussed about chosen ones today firstly giving supporting characters each their own dramatic threads that aren't reliant on the destiny thread makes for a multi dimensional climax and ensures they each independently feel crucial to the resolution of the tension secondly making the destiny thread either an antagonistic force or morally ambiguous can heighten the dramatic tension as well as the thematic and emotional weight around how it unfolds thirdly giving chosen one's character arcs motivation relationships and struggles outside of their chosen as' and not only makes them more relatable but the tension arising from those isn't undermined by their chosen as' however the chosen one should still have arcs related to being the chosen one fourthly in structuring a chosen ones story these elements should be established within the first act and developed alongside any dystiny threads but that's all from me my longest on writing video yet if you want help decide what kind of on writing topics I do in the future then you can come support as supreme and glorious leader Mischka who is in fact the chosen one at patreon there's a link in the description i hope this touched on some things that people don't tend to think about as much when writing chosen ones but what are your thoughts let me know down in the comments

      "mr. Fury's opening chapters are kind of like an exam for a writer they're insanely difficult but vital to your work and they're really where people get to see if you have the skills you get to introduce your main characters and convince your audience like some stranger on the internet just did that you've got something to say and that it will be interesting but how do you write them if you're smashing your head on the disk and response to that question then that's okay that's perfectly normal I've spent the last while trawling through the first chapters of a bunch of books so today's discussion will involve a close breakdown of why these opening chapters works so well we'll be breaking this down into four parts the mini 3x structure opening lines tone into the hook and I'll mostly be excluding prologues in this discussion they really deserve a video of their own but first I want to thank today's video sponsor audible of course you guys know that I am a huge fan of storytelling and you know where stories come from books and if you want to know how to write then and I cannot emphasize this enough reading is about the most important thing that you can do and guess what with audible you can listen to books use my link at audible.com slash hello future me or text hello future me to 500 500 to get a free audiobook and a 30-day trial and stick around till the end of the video to find out which book I recommend but for now ladies and gentlemen on to the video the best way to start your book will vary depending on your genre style and legitimate personal creative choices but there are a number of setups that work better than others so firstly the mini three act structure most writers are somewhat familiar with the three act structure which comes in all shapes and sizes depending on who you ask but a very simple form of it can be useful to structure your opening chapter the basic form being one the introduction of a problem to the exploration of their problem and three the resolution of that problem for example in philip reeves the mortal engines the problem is introduced the protagonist tom isn't allowed to see the city of london chase the town of salt Hook the problems explored tom argues with his mentor and thinks about why he wants to see it so much and the problem is resolved tom sneaks away to see the spectacle in Rick Riordan's Percy Jackson and the lightning thief there is a problem his teacher is actually a monster trying to kill him it is explored he finds the monster ended as resolved he kills the monster by accident the reason the mini three-act structure works so well is because it does more than create an interesting conflict for the writer to explore in their first chapter it allows the writer to show a what kind of conflict of the reader can expect in your story and be how the main character deals with conflicts making your main character seem proactive rather than passive from the beginning which is always more interesting though it is important to note that these problems can be internal or external personal or physical the problem you choose should naturally arise from your world building what kind of problems does this world keeps it your story and create in the mortal engines the first chapter immediately establishes that the lack of resources is a massive source of conflict in the story with cities attacking one another for them in this in turn establishes setting something of a barren wasteland reordan Zopa nning problem immediately establishes that Percy fighting monsters from Greek myth will be the sort of conflicts that the reader can expect which in turn establishes genre a fantasy adventure if the opening chapter problem is about them suffering from a crippling lack of motivation after 5 years of university that has just become mind-numbing by this point then the reader will expect school-based conflict to arise either that or it's probably my biography I just want to be done into this meet that also allows you to introduce how characters approach problems whether they're full of self-doubt overconfidence physically adept or they trick their enemies and this can help introduce aspects of your character especially if they have quirks or a unique perspective on the world then makes them interesting in Artemis Fowl we learned that animist Rex's enemies is relatively utilitarian and ultra intelligent as he tricks the fairy in the opening scene showing the reader how your character solves problems should be a real insight into who they are the mini 3x structure allows the author to go through the who the what the wind the where the why and the how without it feeling like a laundry list of exposition at the beginning though it is worthy of note that many authors use the opening chapter problem as their inciting incident the thing that really launches your main character into the story and that's perfectly fine but in that case the resolution part of the opening chapter doesn't need to mean that they solve the problem it could end in disaster like in the way of Kings by Brandon Sanderson or it could simply be that the main character resolves to fix the problem and so their quest begins it's also interesting to note that as the authors in both Percy Jackson and in the mortal engine stood the opening chapter problem is often used as a form of foreshadowing called a pre scene this is where an earlier plot a phantom omix a much larger version of that event that will appear later on in the story and if you want to know more about how to foreshadow and the different types of foreshadowing then go check out my video on just how to do that secondly opening lines there are very few things more difficult to write than opening chapters in a book but one of them is definitely opening lines these lines can emphasize sitting tone character voice mood conflict tension drama genre theme mystery or the faith that mitochondria is the powerhouse of the cell which I'm sure you didn't know it could be on any element of your story and which you choose will be dependent on the kind of story that you want to write but let's break down some individual fantastic opening lines George Orwell wrote one of my favorite opening lines in his dystopian novel 1984 it was a bright cold day in April and the clocks were striking 13 with this the reader becomes curious because none of this makes sense April was springtime for his audience suggesting hope and life but it's described as cold and the fact the clocks are striking 13 immediately tells the reader something went wrong with this place before he uses this juxtaposition of wither and season effect infection to introduce the theme that just as the characters should the reader should question everything in the world he has built for another example one of the best opening lines that I've read recently comes from the mortal engines it was a dark blustery afternoon in spring and the City of London was chasing a small mining town across the dried out bit of the old North Sea Reeves uses his opening line to establish sitting primarily and from the beginning the withered lifeless world of his dystopian future is established with the mention of a dried-up sea because we immediately associate life with water and the reader becomes interested because this world has led to cities moving even chasing one another introducing the reader to the premise which essentially dictates the whole conflict of the story to come it's an action scene but unlike one we have ever seen before the most persuasive opening lines are seeing and not superfluous to do this it can be effective to not have more than one central idea to your opening line like 1984 chooses to set up its thematic question and it can be tempting to bring in as many intriguing elements of your story as you can because you have so much to say and you want to bring the reader in but picking one central element for that opening line allows the author to narrow the readers focus on something that makes your story stand out this doesn't need to be the most important element of your story but it should be an interesting central element that you focus on in 1984 it primarily works to set up a powerful theme that all well wanted to discuss in the mortal engines the city chase sets up the unique setting of his world and in Kings the gunslinger he opens with the man and blank fled across the desert and the gunslinger followed introducing the conflicts between as protagonist and antagonist for the record when I used the terminology opening line this can include the first paragraph also the same rules still apply in cornelia funke sin cart he takes two paragraphs to establish his central idea that books are magical I could spend all day talking about the opening lines of these famous stories and why they work so well part of the difficulty in picking an opening line that has possess shock factor intrigue and ultimately reflux your story in just one line makes it tempting to write bizarre openers that don't actually set up the story my personal pet peeve example of this you can see in the opening to the Doctor Who episode doomsday we have roast Tyler says the problem with this opening line is that it sets up a central point of tension that doesn't actually happen in any meaningful way it feels more like clickbait read this book now to find out how she died hashtag doctors hate exaggerating a story element to make it more intriguing for the opening line creates an unsatisfactory experience for the reader when the reality is revealed either falsely building tension or creating a misleading basis for your story thirdly sitting the tone ellen brock and either to who has spoken a lot about writing herself and noted that the best thing that you can do for your book is make sure the first chapter adequately represents the tone of the rest of the chapters so the book as a whole seems cohesive in John Green's The Fault in Our Stars the opening chapter introduces the feeling of death hanging over Hazel's head but it's written in a relatively funny and cynical way the reader can tell from how Greene writes about these topics that it's going to be a story that deals with heavy issues sitting a somber tone that will be told with an amusing narrator and it matches the rest of the story now this doesn't mean that if you have a tragic twist - later on that you can't have a happy beginning twists are often accompanied by drastic changes in tone however it does mean that it can be jarring for the reader if the opening chapter problem is what should be a traumatic experience and then chapter 2 is upbeat and comedic this is partly why in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone the first chapter which is technically more of a prologue but it is called chapter 1 skips the traumatic scene of depicting the death of Harry's parents and goes straight to the celebrations of Baltimore's fall and the whimsical Dumbledore it's more consistent with the tone of the rest of the story now this isn't a video on building tones so we won't go too in depth on it but we will touch on it because it's clearly relevant to the discussion it can be built in the first chapter in any number of ways it can be established with the focus of your imagery focusing on how the wind and the rain is tearing the leaves off trees establishes a pessimistic tone while focusing on how one beautiful flower survives the wind and rain establishes an optimistic tone it can be established by using the stakes of the opening problem in the opening scene of Shakespeare's King Lear the opening problem that Cordelia faces is needing to prove how much she loves her father the King and almost everything in her inheritance is at stake here establishing a far more serious tone to the story fun to me though tone is the lease about what happens and more about how you say it it's about the feelings that you invoke in the reader with imagery diction characterization and emphasis and finally the hook one of the biggest misunderstandings that people seem to have is that they can fight to the inciting incident with the hook the inciting incident is the thing that launches your character into their quest whatever it is while the hook on the other hand is the very first moment in your story that intrigues the reader and makes them want to know more a great example of this is in The Last Airbender and ha you thought I wasn't gonna mention my favorite show ever that I could go one episode without referencing this fantastic series you would be wrong in the opening episode of The Last Airbender the inciting incident is soccer and Katara chanting across the frozen avatar aang a few people have suggested that the hook is Katara using waterbending because it makes people want to know more about this world but it's actually far earlier than that it's this moment immediately the viewers left asking why did the avatar vanish where did they go in most cases the hook does one of two things either it causes the reader to ask a question that they wish to know more about or it sets up a controversial statement that they may or may not agree with the most famous example of this is Pride and Prejudice it is a truth universally acknowledged that a young man in position of a large fortune must be in want of a wife of course my response to this is why have a wife when you can have cats it should be noted here that not every first chapter needs an inciting incident they often happen in the first chapter but they also often happen in the second or third chapters - all first chapters do however need a hook I want to be clear there are an infinite number of things that we could discuss on the first chapter as the first chapter can be done in an infinite number of ways but most writers know that they have to introduce characters set the tone setting and so on but that advice isn't all that helpful unless you learn how to do those things this was a close look at some essential often overlooked elements of the first chapter that might give you a structure to sort of do those other things that you already know you need and of course I'd like to thank today's sponsor audible to quote John Green reading is just as important as writing when you're trying to be a writer because it's the only apprenticeship we have something that I truly and wholeheartedly believe in and audibles unmatched selection is one way to make experiencing

so thank you to those of you who do so what have we discussed today about writing the first chapter firstly using the mini 3x structure gives you the opportunity to introduce your setting and characters in interesting ways as you show what kind of problems arise in your world and how your character approaches them secondly effective opening lines tend to be succinct and not superfluous to do this introduce only one central element to your story that makes it interesting the conflicts the setting the theme or otherwise however don't exaggerate these ideas for a victory to reveal them as an ordinary late thirdly first chapters tend to work when their tone is consistent with the rest of the story this can be done with stakes imagery diction emphasis and many other tools fourthly the hook and the inciting incident are two different story elements but a first chapter must have a hook this usually takes the form of a question that makes the reader want to know more or a statement of eternal principle and if you enjoyed this then we have a patreon only discord for those of you who want to support me in the community we have a writing tab which allows us to talk about our stories

religions your sad devotion to that ancient religion I find your lack of faith disturbing and today we'll be focusing on one type of religion polytheism where there are multiple gods that all come within the same pantheon like the Greek pantheon this video will be a little bit different to my usual style with a strong focus on the world building itself and how religions actually work but we will still touch on how it can fit with character developments narrative tension and so on now I've noticed that most world building religion resources focus on the following things which are great questions to ask but most authors have already thought about them they're not particularly complex we're gonna get into the nitty-gritty so instead we'll be splitting this incredibly complex topic into nine yes a whopping nine points religious beliefs themselves the variation of religious beliefs how polytheistic religions spread religion and culture religion and politics religion in the economy narrative teams Namath appear religious tropes and models and character development and religion they're magic systems whoo okay let's get started most authors know that win world building a religion that the religion needs some form of belief but more importantly it's critical to understand one thing when coming up with this religious philosophy religion is complicated let me repeat that religion is complicated and when I say this I mean that all religions have a belief of some kind and most world building religion resources I've come across focus on saying that our religion should answer these three questions how did the world come to be how should we act towards one another and what happens when we die but these three questions aren't requirements for world building a religion in George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire the religion of the many faced God believes in the principle their death is a mercy not a curse but it has nothing to say on how the world was created and there's little to say on where we go when we die and even less to say on how we should interact with one another those aren't important questions to that religion while it's true that many world religions focus on these three questions that doesn't mean that your fictional one has to answer any or all of them your religion may focus on one of these questions or focus on something else entirely religion is not limited to these three questions and limiting yours to it Ken but what certainly make it feel cut and paste like it's just taking the template of the major world religions today why because religion is complicated maybe your religions just like hey murder isn't wrong but we should definitely build everything out of beef jerky but let's talk about variation in religious belief because on another level where your religion does have beliefs on these three questions it doesn't mean that all of its adherents agree on what those beliefs are and this can play a critical role in your world building these disagreements can arise because of interpretation of religious texts accepting or denying certain prophets or one group emphasizing certain values within the religion while another group emphasizes other values even if the gods themselves came down and explained about what they meant and this is only compounded when it comes to polytheistic Pantheon's because it's common for the gods to represent different principles values or ideas meaning that followers naturally divided themselves into different groups that align with certain gods and certain values in the Dragonlance series measure represents faith and meditation while Khadijah life represents courage and heroism there isn't a single religious institution that encompasses all of the gods or a single religious authority or a single religious group rather Messiah has his own followers even if he has very few of them who are mostly monks and priests while Khadijah life as a large group of followers who are mostly warriors and mercenaries and we can see the world-building tying religion to the economy here because the continent of insalaum where the story takes place is often plagued by war and conflict meaning a large sector of the economy are employed as soldiers meaning the warrior god holds greater sway they aren't all equal either in income or in worship or in follower numbers and showing which group has the most influence in society can emphasize what kind of society this is depending on what your fictional society values some gods on your Pantheon may be portrayed as more important and this will affect how much power their group has politically how much money they have and how ingrained their traditions their rituals their practices are in society and within these six who is to say that there aren't different interpretations of the same God why is this religion is complicated but a more critical question when it comes to world building is what makes a society value certain things more and thereby certain gods more this is often simplified I've seen and fantasy stories to what a society values morally like wisdom or courage but history shows us that it's a lot more complex than that the avatar the last airbender mythology does this extremely well because it's often to do with geography and what makes living in a certain landscape difficult so people call on certain gods that they would need to support them in that environment in the episode The Painted Lady a small river village relies entirely on its fish supply from the Janki River to survive so they emphasize the Painted Lady over other spirits a freshwater River spirit who protects the river and we can see this in ancient Egypt which was a largely dry and arid area so they revered the god harpy the god of the Nile who was responsible for the annual flooding of the Nile it ensured they had a good harvest and sufficient water and food in the environment that they lived in often it'll be economic and Chinese mythology Kenshin the God of the silkworm rose to prominence because of how critical their control of the silk trade was to their prosperity they concluded it must be divine but it can also be cultural the Water Tribe Revere's the moon and ocean spirits who gave them waterbending but they also embody the values of balance here Nanyang and cooperation which are very important to their personal religious philosophy and author can demonstrate the diversity of their gods and the diversity of their culture within a region by showing how different groups interpret the same Pantheon a society may choose to emphasize or worship a few gods of the pantheon more for economic political and geographical reasons even if the mythology itself doesn't necessarily say that this deity is more important just as religion shaped society society helps decide the form that that religion takes but how much variation should there be win world building your religion well three important factors to consider our territory the number of followers and how young the religion is the smaller the territory the less variation they will be because two different interpretations are unlikely to flourish in the same space this is why splits within the Christian Church are also largely geographical likewise the few of the followers the more likely there can be agreement between them all and the younger the religion is the less time it has to become challenged and evolved and so now we need to talk about how polytheistic religions spread and funnily enough we're actually going to talk about Christianity a monotheistic religion as a case study but you'll see why in a moment so Christianity spread like wildfire across Europe in the third to ninth centuries absorbing early religion after religion Celtic Germanic and in later centuries it would go on to absorb Slavic ones and part of the reason that it was able to do this was painter and saints there's a patron saint for the people who work with explosives patron saint for single people and even a patron saint for hangovers for all you people who were said that you're still calling on the patron saint of single people so how did Christianity do it well they sort of did this thing we're instead of telling people that their gods didn't exist and they had to convert they sort of went yeah no your gods are still out there don't worry they're just not quite gods and so people like Saint Brigid come along representing the great Irish Celtic goddess brick this helped Christianity absorb smaller religions into the faith because it allowed people to keep their personal identity and their value system while still being Christian now while this is a monotheistic example the point is is that polytheistic religions are very good at this if they were already a large number of gods especially if that number has changed over time then it may be natural that when people add their own gods they just go yeah why not let's have a god of kicking people we've done like in the balls comparatively if there are only a small number of gods it's still polytheistic but say 2 or 3 then its followers may be less inclined to add new gods because followers all agree that these are the only gods that they accept and why is this religion is complicated one of the most important elements of effective world-building is interconnectivity how your politics are fix your economy how your economy affects the military and here how your religious Pantheon affects everything else of anything religion is usually most closely connected with culture and one of the most difficult questions is how to actually incorporate all of this info that you've come up with without dumping exposition and then in the year 300 of the dawn times the seven gods turned all the witches into sand and that's how we got sandwiches there is a really good article on this on the world-building sec exchange site by sea Agrippa which I've linked in the description below but one of the best ways to world build your religion is to show how it affects ordinary people on an ordinary daily basis that is what culture is like how we say bless you when someone sneezes in Brandon Sanderson's the way of Kings voron ism has a strong belief in gender roles that men are leaders and warriors and women are scholars and artists because of this men are not meant to read and write one major outcome of this is that the academic realm of culture is entirely made up of women and as women are the ones that know history mathematics and science this heavily affects political power dynamics within the society as well as the economy women are the engineers they're the political advisors through the innovators in society the inventors allowing them to occupy wealthy positions and at the same time Voronezh emplace is a huge emphasis on modesty of women how they're expected to dress with a safe hand glove it's against social protocol to look inside a woman's glove and doing so is incredibly inappropriate it's kind of sexual like wise men if they do only read in secret another great question to ask is do followers consider it a father-son relationship with their God or a brother-sister relationship or a sixth uncle twice removed or otherwise most importantly the average citizen won't understand all the nuances and theology of their religion but the ideas that the reader sees affecting their daily lives whether it be in their speech how they hold themselves this will represent the most ingrained and pervasive ideas of their religion without explicitly stating them but it's contextualizes - polytheism it can be interesting to see how the followers of different gods are affected differently on a daily basis because as we mentioned before they might have different value systems or different practices more interestingly do different gods have a different relationship with humans maybe one has a father-son type relationship one is a mother daughter or another is a toddler that just killed its sex goldfish and pit now how polytheism works in the daily life of mortals is often tied to a cost-benefit analysis of the religion what do they give up and what do they gain eternal life eternal donuts do they have to kill their children well though they just have to toast some marshmallows to their God each morning what would the ordinary person in their daily life give up and what would they be so concerned about losing or gaining to make sure that they keep worshiping they're not going to be loyal to a religion just because there's usually some level of personal investment and fantasy stories often have magic systems one of my favorite topics and if you want to learn a whole lot more about them then go to click on my three-part series which a lot of people have enjoyed and in connecting it with your polytheistic religion is incredibly common if the gods are very real and they interact with people then it's common for magic to be divine coming from the gods themselves like in david eddings in selenium and within that polytheistic religions often divide powers up amongst the gods meaning some F control of life or death or fire or nature you can give them whichever spheres you so want this could mean the channeling or worshipping one of those gods gives you a certain type of magic in our videos on hard magick and soft magick we talked about the importance of reliability and limits and costs and weaknesses and polytheism provides a great way to play with that perhaps using the gods power exposes you to also their weaknesses or a God chooses to limit how much power a person can have or maybe you have to bargain with their God for their magic putting a price on it like your soul which we often see in shows like supernatural likewise if gods can control and limit magic then it's subject to their decisions and their whim and emotions if they are very temperamental then there's nothing to suggest that magic is reliable or consistent they only give it to their most faithful perhaps it can be tied to sacrifices there's endless possibilities to play with and now religion and politics because who doesn't enjoy toxic comment sections they have a long-standing relationship but we'll be focusing on a couple of factors that are particularly pertinent when it comes to polytheism so history has shown us that religion is often used to validate political authorities like the Chinese emperor ruling via the Mandate of Heaven or the crowning of the Emperor of Constantinople but history has also shown us that it can come into conflict with political authorities like how the papacy and the Holy Roman Emperor competed for authority in Europe during the 12th or 13th centuries but it's notable that societies with polytheistic religions don't tend to rely on their religion of validating their political authorities as much nor do they challenge political authorities as much as monotheism and there's a very good reason for this polytheism tends to create decentralized religious power this is because as we've discussed they tend to divide into smaller factions as groups of people emphasize one or a small selection of the group of gods in the pantheon political authorities on the other hand whether it's a king or Emperor have their power spread across all of their land they have widespread military support a huge variety in their sources of income and their one single cohesive institution generally speaking across all of their land in contrast in polytheism no single faction is likely to have the support the money or the widespread geographical institutionalism needed to challenge and rival the political powers in the land this is the way that monotheistic religions usually can this is because they have centralized powers just one institution that isn't split into a whole lot of different factions so in what way do they exert power over the political authorities well it tends to be defections within these Pantheon's that exert the influence over smaller areas or cities within the larger region for example both Athens and Sparta recognize - the whole of the Greek pantheon but Athens took up Athena and emphasized wisdom while Sparta placed importance on Apollo and Artemis tanned emphasized the hunt poetry and archery because hotspots of these different gods and factions tend to evolve another effective way to world abilities to interconnect your religion with the economy in A Song of Ice and Fire the faith of the seven plays the role of the social safety net in the economy this role and how they carry it out we can see through Brian's experiences at the sit when we meet the wandering symptom the actions of the high Sparrow and others it shows the reader that the faith values humility caring for the poor opposes extravagance and has a strong belief in justice both rich beautif and restorative to take this principle and apply it to polytheistic Pantheon's as we discussed Pantheon's tend to split their followers into factions that emphasize certain values or gods and one way to world build all of the different gods into your society is to show how they play different roles in the economy perhaps one faction who follows the warrior God and helps run the local militia to protect the town or the faction of the god of Commerce uses its money to make loans to those who need it to continue with the faith of the seven example which is technically monotheistic we see the seven different aspects of their God playing different roles in society we have the Warriors sons defending the faith and its followers and we have the silent sisters who usually follow the mother caring for the dead the sick and dying given your polytheistic affections different roles in society and the economy helps lay out the different values and beliefs surrounding each God but let's talk about world building narrative tension and polytheistic NetHope er I know big words just hang on for a second matha Pia is where gods derive their power from the worship prayer or attention of their followers so they can become stronger or weaker depending on that if you can imagine Zeus buckling over getting fat and exhausted because people haven't been killing enough sheep for him then yeah that's how it works the epitome of this is in Neil Gaiman's famous work American Gods where the old gods like Odin and Loki are dying because the new gods are rising like that if the Internet are in cars because people don't believe in the old ones anymore in they're believing in these new ones on a side note this is less common but not impossible with monotheism that they tend to stay away from it because of the theme of the omniscient omnipotent omnipresent godlike figure who holds up the universe if they're being undermined as a being then well what's gonna happen to the universe that tends to be the question that they ask and this concept is a really interesting and common source of conflict and narratives that focus on polytheism in Terry Pratchett's fantastic books small gods gods try to get their followers to undermine other gods even within the same pantheon to help sustain them and boost their power if people fear that their God is dying then how will they get more followers more sacrifices more worship well they take them by force will they sacrifice humans to make up for it it author has to consider how this affects the interactions between different factions that emphasize different gods within the pantheon or alternatively how it affects the relationship with other Pantheon's different types of religions all coming in within the same melting pot of a society on another level and I'm only mentioning this because I think the concept is super cool meth appiah is sometimes reciprocal and that not only do gods live by belief but they actually change depending on what their followers believe about them and this can play with some really interesting ideas because societies change society values evolve people change an author can take this in any number of fascinating ways in rick riordan terrors of Olympus series two different groups with competing ideals about what their gods should be like come into conflict and this ring did the gods essentially mad unable to intervene and what happens when the gods can't intervene and finally it can be interesting to mix religious models religious structures that we find in our world when designing our fictional religion world building naturally draws on things that we see in our world and understand to give our fictional worlds the sense of realism a sense of grounding so that the reader does believe that it can happen because of this it can be easy to fall into the pre-existing models that we see in polytheistic religions like the Greek Roman and Norse Pantheon's we're familiar with them there are any number of chokes that typically define this but these tend to be that they're based around a generational mythology that they have families of God's with husbands wives sons daughters and so on and that the gods tend to have very human behavior there are other tropes but these ones are very common and there's thing wrong with that setup inherently but one way to differentiate your polytheistic religion is to draw on the tropes that we see in other religious models whether it's pantheism monotheism dualism animism shamanism ancestor worship or others in tokine's mythology into Aluva tar is the monotheistic one true God but the angelic beings known as the Vela operate a lot more like a polytheistic Pantheon there are family with husbands wives sons and daughters with the typical spheres that we see in the Greek type Pantheon and one of my favorites there's a fascinating mix of shamanism and polytheism in Lovecraft's Cthulhu Mythos we're interacting with the pantheon of gods often requires a state of madness or causes you to go mad likewise the dragon Lance series has an interesting mix of dualism and polytheism or more try ISM there's no Supreme God but there are three different groups of gods the good and the neutral and the evil all existing and constant balance and conflict and for a real-world example before Irish mythology was anglicized it had an interesting mix of polytheism and dualism where there were these two groups of godlike beings the Tuatha dÃ© Danann which were largely good and the form ourian's which were largely destructive gods but another important question is whether your polytheism is more in line with Western ideas or with Eastern ideas are they a strict pantheon of purely deities who are definitely superior and above humans or are they a collection of otherworldly and distant spirits that fulfill their roles in the natural worlds they might not even be sentient like in Princess Mononoke and Avatar The Last Airbender your Pantheon doesn't need to be either of these it can be a mixture and we shouldn't get stuck in relying on one of these two models relying purely on tropes that we identify with major Pentiums from our world can lead to our fictional religious Pantheon's feeling unoriginal because the gods are just placeholder deities for Zeus and Poseidon even if the exact powers of the gods differ a little mixing tropes from monotheism mysticism dualism shamanism animism ancestor worship or elsewise as well as Western and Eastern conceptions of what polytheism is can help your religion stand out as unique and why is this important jeana's complicated and lastly let's briefly talk about character development and that second question we talked about at the beginning which was whether or not the religion had anything to say about how we should interact with one another fantasy stories often have characters being born into a society with a dominant religion that's ingrained into the people ingrained into the society but the thing is if this religion has any values or beliefs about how we should act with others then this should be ingrained into most characters this provides two avenues for character development firstly this can restrict our characters are willing to act like scar and formula Alchemist whose religion prevented him from performing alchemy and he had to figure out a way to work around that and he did so by destroying instead of reconstructing and this might mean that many characters within your story may have a similar moral code which can be but isn't always less interesting it can just be more fascinating to the reader if there's a diversity of moral compasses secondly this can provide for a great point of tension where they are forced into situations that challenge their morals forcing them to change or become more resolute like in the Goblin Emperor by Kathryn Edison with a character Meyer struggles to follow his religion while also being a ruler but if the character doesn't follow these dominant religious values then the author has to explain why this character doesn't follow its Tennant if everyone else around them does polytheism provides for an easy way around this because different gods can have entirely different values meaning characters can just pick whichever god they want hmm god of piety and kindness or the god of wine hmm alternatively having a dominant religion that doesn't have laws on how characters should interact with one another perhaps focusing on the other questions or different things entirely allows you to have characters who all grow up under the same religion but can act differently have a diverse range of morals but before we go any further I would like to thank today's sponsor audible because right now if you go to audible.com slash hello

dune or some other book that you think I should read that has fantastic world building I would love to hear what you have to say so what have we covered today well firstly while many world religions focus on the three questions that doesn't mean your fictional one has to answer any or all of them secondly polytheistic religions tend to result in a lot of variation in religious belief as people divide into groups that emphasize certain gods for geographical cultural or economic reasons variation is also dependent on territory numbers of followers and how old the religion is thirdly polytheistic religions tend to be more adaptable and can absorb other religions into them allowing them to evolve over time fourthly one of the best ways to world build your religion is to show how it affects ordinary people culturally on an ordinary daily basis fifthly polytheistic religions tend to compete less with the regional powers than monotheistic religions would because they often have a decentralized religious power with multiple groups not quite matching the unified power of the state sixthly demonstrating how these polytheistic groups all fit into society and the economy in particular is a great way to show the diversity of values and beliefs surrounding each god seventhly where gods live and die by worship thus being math Appiah this can be a great source of conflict within the narrative as factions compete or undermine one another for their gods and 8th lis don't be afraid to mix religious models and tropes purely relying on polytheistic tropes that we see in our world can lead to a stale and unoriginal pantheon it doesn't need to be organized religion that is all from me if you would like to support the channel see more of this kind of content see background

      "in terms of literary analysis what is the point of the Shire in talking to the Lord of the Rings it's the home of the hobbits Frodo merry Pippin and Sam and it immediately conjures up that music that we all know and love tokine spends nearly a hundred ten pages of his 407 page The Fellowship of the Ring in just the Shire that's nearly 27 percent of this supposed adventure book taking place in one sitting to compare this to Star Wars a new hope Luke spends only 16 percent of the film in his Shire Tatooine and in the force awakens race means only nine percent of her screen time in her Shire jakku token clearly intended the Shire to play a very important role in the narrative so let's talk about what that might be the first thing that the show does in the narrative is it establishes what Joseph Campbell called the ordinary world in his book the hair of a Thousand Faces Campbell popularized an idea that many of you will be familiar with the hero's journey and the ordinary world is a central concept to that it's the beginning point in the story that establishes a norm for the reader a status quo that the characters exist in that will be disrupted later on in the plot kick-starting the story the ordinary world is the one in which strange things do not happen the one in which the main character is just going about their everyday life and tokens ordinary world in the Shire is not just ordinary but opposed to the unordinary one of the first things that we learn of hobbits is that they are in an unobtrusive people they love peace and quiet they like to have books filled with things that they already knew sit-out fair and square with no contradictions they know what they know and they know that they don't know what they don't know and they're happy with that and we later learn that they're somewhat wary and suspicious of Bilbo with his unordinary treasures from the outside world from Smaug hoard it's critical to note that in the hero's journey narrative structure the ordinary world can be a mental or a physical state or a mix of both but toki made it very physical in the shire and this leads us to the second function of the shire and tokine's narrative it helps us empathize without two main characters Frodo and Sam there is also this beautiful hand-drawn map and on a side note this is one of the most beautiful books that I own it is just absolutely incredible I wanted it for years finally got it and I just like having it interestingly toking grounds the Shire in the human world more than any other place in middle-earth with names such as took and brandybuck and the name of the place itself Shire drawing on English it Mogi and language with places like berkshire its description of grasslands and green rolling hills reflects the English countryside and this immediately sets up by dynamic whereby Frodo and Sam leaving the Shire is a transliteration for leaving our own ordinary world our human one and this is only reinforced by talking with a note on the very first page of the prologue to the Fellowship of the Ring but hobbits have never in fact studied magic of any kind the hero's journey in the Lord of the Rings sits up an ordinary non-medical world and contrasts it with an extraordinary magical worlds that we know is out there and just like Sam yearning to see the elves we long to see it too the Shire serves as a very physical grounding point for the reader sitting us in the shoes of those venturing outside of the non-medical ordinary world into the magical extraordinary world the third purpose of the Shire serves in the narrative is that it helps establish a motivation for the characters fundamentally Frodo Sam Marion Pepin only really lived for one reason to save the Shire there was the scope of their world and they each keep returning to it throughout the story when Sam sees the burning of the Shire in the mirror of Galadriel that motivates him rather than weakens him across just the Fellowship of the Ring the Shire is mentioned 331 times that's nearly once per page and we get plenty of lines like this then add a great distance as if coming out of memories of the Shire some sunlit early morning when the day called and doors were opening he heard Sam's voice speaking the Shire is continually used as this reference point for all things that are good worth protecting and more importantly worth returning to one of my favorite moments in Jackson's trilogy truly captures this we'll be spring soon the orchards will be in blossom and the birds will be nesting in the hazel thicket repeatedly talking shows us that home is worth remembering it's worth returning to even after all they've seen throughout middle-earth it's even worth dying for return journey mr. farmer talking gave us something real and tangible to care about right from the beginning the stakes of the story are less about what Sauron wants to do to the world and more about what our characters the hobbits care about this is one of the reasons that middle-earth has such a strong sense of place the Shire isn't just a sitting it has a whole lot of feelings and experiences attached to it it's why we get the warm and fuzzies when we hear this music and these feelings culminate in the fourth critical function that the Shire serves in the narrative what Joseph Campbell called in the hero's journey the return the return is the moment at the end of the story where our heroes re-enter into their ordinary world has changed people having learned more about themselves and the wider world while the return can be mental or physical tokens emphasis on world building made this a very physical return to the Shire much like how it was a very physical ordinary world at the beginning to compare this to jakku in the force awakens or Tatooine in a new hope for both ray and Luke they're ordinary worlds are set up at the beginning as a mental place of peace and everyday life this is why when it comes to the end of their journey the return is not a physical one for either of them things go back to their ordinary world of peace and everyday life yes but they never return to these places that they came from this is part of the reason why in my opinion readers tend to care more about the Shire than they do about jakku or Tatooine the setting of the Shire itself plays a critical role in understanding the hero's journey in the story the physical return to the Shire is a return to peace to order to home the Shire is the connective tissue that brings the hero's journey full circle this just isn't the case for either jakku or Tatooine they don't return there when they return to their ordinary world meaning they don't play that same role in its narrative structure oh but what about the scouring of the shire that's a great question you leave the fetish lighthouse because I could hear some of you saying something curious happens at the end of The Return of the King so it would seem like the natural place for the story to end as when the One Ring was destroyed and the major dramatic threat was resolved but no Tolkien wasn't finished because when the hobbits first returned to the shire they find that has been taken over and corrupted by Sodom on with its trees felled and its waters poisoned and now Frodo Sam Mary and pepijn must rouse the wrist of the hobbits to fight them off and cast them out David Harvey in his book the song of middle-earth has a really interesting commentary on this the hobbits do not seek a particular objective their quest is to return to the place from whence they came but they do not appreciate that they return in a different from that in which they started when they returned to the Shire they find it changed for the worse but yeah there's a whole lot of really interesting stuff about talking of ethology again and it's this moment that the shy fulfills its fifth critical role in the narrative by realizing one of Tolkien's big themes war changes everything so talking fought in the trenches of World War one he had to make decisions of life and death and he saw his friends fall and die around him he was no stranger to the idea that war changes people he intimately understood that even though the hero yearns to go back to their ordinary world of peace and innocence before all of it began you might return but you're never truly the same and there Sam exclaims on finding the Shire this is worse than Mordor becomes home to you they say because it is home and you remember it before was ruined Mordor has come to the Shire because war is not just something that happens to and changes the outside world it's something that changes us internally as well and this is an idea that Tolkien actually introduces in the first act of the Fellowship of the Ring the wide world is all about you you can find yourselves in you cannot forever fence it out and though we might win every single battle out there in the extraordinary world our ordinary world can never be the same again [Music] but that is all from me a question of the day which fictional place are you most sentimentally attached to I'm probably most attached to the Shire to be honest that's kind of why I liked making this video so much other places might be mmm most fictional universes that I'm really into don't have as kind of iconic places as the Shire let me know yours down the comments below if you enjoyed this sort of literary analysis because this is sort of a cross between my own writing series and Lord of the Rings ish then please consider supporting me on patreon come joining the patreon discord we get to talk about on writing a lot get to talk about Lord of the Rings anything else you want to talk about it's really cool little community we have there and thank you of course to my patrons who have been supporting me so far you really do mean the world also another video soon this is my biggest model and most expensive by far because stupid shipping to DeLand and I will be doing an unboxing video feel free to leave me your questions to do with on a totally unrelated note Harry Potter and this can be to do with law or to do with like how the story is written in the meantime come follow me on all my social medias stayin any sub furious and I'll see you in the future\n",

      "last video we talked about how to communicate exposition we do this through the unknowledgeable perspective character making it interesting with narrative payoffs blending with characterization conflict and environmental descriptions really recommend that you go check that out before going into this video there's a link up in the corner of the screen but often a more critical question is what information actually needs to be delivered this is one thing that those who have a slight addiction to world buildings sometimes struggle with the writers who build elaborate intricate worlds where they know the complex ins and outs of their magic system their politics their religions economy society and everything else down to the later which is great but it can be tempting to include everything to communicate it all because you want your reader to experience all of this fascinating stuff that you've put together and that's understandable but part of the exposition problem is that not all of this is important or interesting to the reader so it's critical to understand this not every part of your world building needs to be explicitly communicated so what do we need to actually include one of the only types of truly necessary exposition when it comes to your complex worlds building is problem solving exposition this is the crucial information that will play a major role in the development of resolution of the conflict the clearest example of this is Isaac Asimov's three rules of Robotics introduced in its short story run around the reader knowing these rules is critical to them understanding the development of the tension in the story and it's also critical to understanding how that tension is resolved when the robot known as speedy X in accordance with the first law over the second and the third laws in the model engines it's not really explained how the 60-minute war destroyed the world because while it may be an important part of its world building it's not an important element of the narrative conflict sometimes background world building information is best used as knowledge that the author can draw on when they need to in creating a consistent and complex world for the reader however parts of your world building that are also problem-solving and being used to resolve or build tension in the narrative if character will do action X to resolve the plot then the reader needs to understand why that works within your world building and let's take a closer look at exposition and magic systems it can be tempting to explain the complex magic system you have built down to the tiniest detail it might be the amazing concept that makes your world unique but in terms of experience for the reader the real question is this does it help establish a sense of consistency in the narrative by making the resolution to conflict more satisfying in the Lord of the Rings Gandalf magic isn't usually explained because it's not often used to solve problems and where it is it comes with a great cost the fellowship loses Gandalf to the Balrog explaining this wouldn't actually create a more satisfying resolution to the obstacles that the fellowship faces in the story in contrast to Brandon Sanderson spins pages of Miss porn just explaining his magic system because it plays such a critical role in how the conflict is resolved if you want more information on writing magic systems then I recommend you check out my three-part series that got the on writing series started in the first place an example of bad magic system exposition is this moment in Star Wars The Phantom Menace lorian's are microscopic life-forms living together advantage they continually speak to us here is that knowing this element of the magic system the force doesn't help understand the problems that are solved later on in the story so it feels out of place this is also an example of the unknowledgeable perspective character anakin who is meant to be asking the questions that the viewer would many chlorines they live inside me symbionts but the problem is no viewer is asking this question nix Lee it can be but isn't always important to communicate exposition that explains why characters make the decisions that they do this is most commonly in the form of backstory that we don't see in the narrative past traumas or experiences that shift how they see the world in Avatar The Last Airbender we see flashbacks of Zuko's banishment that explained why hunting the avatar will get him his honor back and also why he eventually chooses to help his crew members trapped in a storm rather than pursuing in this episode making a more relatable and are sympathize with him on a sidenote where you do want to explore backstory it can often be more compelling to write out the actual scene than to have them recount it to others storyteller style the exception to this is that it's often more interesting to have a character whose background or reasons for writing are more mysterious or outside the perspective character's understanding and meta to the bone by David monk the characters avian has virtually nothing about their backstory ever revealed and that mystery is used to keep them interesting with characters unsure of whether or not they can trust them the author might know the backstory of a character but that doesn't mean that the reader has to know it mysterious characters can fuel intrigue in the story in like snape meaning this is exposition that doesn't necessarily need to be communicated immediately in contrast to the backstories of characters like Zuko and Aang are shared in order to make them more relatable to the reader however some big stories neither make the characters more relatable or create intrigue so sharing them may just be raw exposition that serves no real purpose in the narrative meaning it may not need to be shared even if the author knowing it helps them construct and write to the character but we're not done with this topic we'll be talking a little bit more about backstory exposition and when you should share it and what that means for the story at this time so skip towards this if you're really keen to watch that finally the reality is is that when it comes to what exposition you should share it's that you are free to include any exposition about your worlds or story you like if that element is important to you you need to write the story the way you want that doesn't mean it'll be the most compelling information for the reader but if it's important to you then find a way to stick it in just try your best to do it well the next point about exposition is this respect your audience they're smart a lot of good exposition tells the story implicitly through conflict and environmental descriptions they can pick up that there are complex political factions at play from the propaganda about other parties we know there was an apocalypse in the road from its ruined cities or that a character was abused from the scars on their forearms even if they don't get the exact story that you have in mind sometimes leaving a lot to ambiguity or reading between the lines gives the sense of a wider world to the reader without having to fully explain it and allowing the reader that creativity to imagine what it's like can make your world actually more immersive and for our last question when should you communicate exposition let's return to that point about backstories so to clarify this point whether you should reveal backstory is not a binary choice between intrigue and relatability it's about when you reveal it it's incredibly common for authors to reveal backstory but to choose to do so later on in the story to build tension throughout it for example Remus Lupin as a werewolf Snape loved Lily and Dumbledore was power-hungry these are three secondary characters whose banks stories are revealed later on after tension builds up around them you can do both but there is a reason that it's more common to reveal the backstory of perspective characters earlier on for example there are no real surprises about Harry Ron or her - history later on in the story this is because revealing backstory exposition earlier on in the story is one method to help the reader empathize with the character they get to know them better this is most common with perspective characters like Aang in contrast to revealing backstory later in the narrative especially if you drop hints about it previously helps create intrigue in the narrative this is most common with secondary characters like snake so it's about which one of those two factors you want to emphasize as do when you drop it but as mentioned before if a backstory doesn't really add to either of these then maybe you don't need to share it at all while characterization environmental descriptions and the conflict points we discussed last video are a great way to make exposition easy to digest one extremely effective way to make exposition more memorable is with a plot twist this can be done either before the exposition or after the exposition one criticism of Inception is its expositional scene in which Ellen Page is just a stand-in for the viewer to understand how the dreamworld works this is an example of the unknowledgeable perspective character we talked about before and there's nearly four straight minutes of exposition but it's curtailed by this moment plot twists that demonstrate the exposition you've just read or exposition that explains a plot twist - they have just read tie the exposition to a critical moment in the story or a distinct moment of imagery like we see in Inception it makes it more memorable than it otherwise would be because the main feature of the scene isn't the exposition itself but the demonstration of that exposition a more subtle version of the plot twist method is to give the characters mistakes such as in interstellar brand passes comment on the mountains and the distance but it's soon revealed that these are very much not mountains but instead giant waves the information we will need to believe is proven false through demonstration and makes the correct information more memorable and here's we need to talk about the first chapter it can be tempting to start off with a grand exposition that beautifully lays out the history of your world and the setting of your beloved characters and some great authors like talking did precisely that but the trend these days is against that sort of exposition dump the reasons that it's difficult to care about a world a society or remember a magic system unless the reader is given some context in which to care about it we are immersed and remember things about the Shire through the experiences of Frodo we care about the hundred year war by seeing its consequences and how Katara and Sokka lost their mother and we remember how the dreamworld works by seeing how its used to sit-up conflicts or resolve them memorable and interesting exposition almost never exists in a vacuum because of this it more effective to use the first chapter to establish an immersive context in which the exposition can be later introduced rather than spouting the exposition itself but lastly spreading exposition out across the narrative and across multiple characters can help by avoiding huge chunks of informational text that holds the action this makes it easier to digest it creates a dimension of interaction between characters opening it up more as a discussion with different perspectives perhaps giving people different ways to phrase things or emphasize things instead of it being read in a single tone which can feel monotonous so what has part to discuss today firstly not all world building needs to be communicated but it's important to communicate problem-solving exposition that controls tension in the narrative this applies equally to magic systems secondly it can be important to communicate exposition that explains why characters act a certain way to create relatable characters but it can also be interesting to have a character with a mysterious background thirdly respect your audience they will read through the lines in your descriptions and directions and dialogue that creativity can make the world more immersive fourthly plot twist before after the exposition are a great way to make the exposition more memorable fifthly it's generally better to avoid first chapter exposition dumps and rather to use the first chapter as a means to establish an immersive context in which the exposition can be given later but that is all for me if you like the sort of more educational content then consider joining my discord patreon community for just a couple of dollars a month we talk about world building writing and all that it's great also the midi-chlorians example is pretty bad and I'm not even a prequel Heder I grew up on it I have a weird place in my heart for them question today what do you think is one of the best world build stories that is not well known quite obscure perhaps I'm really enjoying the world of

      "at last the Dark Lord's evil empire has been established and its show lasts into eternity why what do you mean why why would it last forever because will conquer everyone and everyone's just gonna like accept that well don't play by the rules snowflake new country and how do you stay in power exactly that power fear is that really an efficient long-term administration strategy I mean don't let me tell you how to do your job as Dark Lord but have you ever considered a propaganda mill people are surprisingly easy to convince or maybe an inter marital alliance control the production of major resources well not exactly as the Dark Lord fought through this at all well he came up with the whole no flag no country thing I thought that was pretty good what keeps an empire working they featuring any number of stories particularly in science fiction and fantasy sprawling across planets and galaxies or hulk continents but when it comes to world building them honestly books have a pretty shocking track record of these amorphous powers that just exist and work because plot in part two will actually be looking at how empires rise and fall but today in part one we'll be looking at how they work while creates a realistic Empire and prevent it from collapsing so we'll be focusing on the three C's communication control and commerce these are by no means the only things in Empire needs but they are three important pillars towards stability this video comes as a special request of one of my absolutely amazing patrons and discord Ahmad sarcastic Geum who is actually doing his PhD thesis and the stuff so he helped me write the video if you'd like to suggest a topic of your own then there's a link to my patreon down in the description we would love for you to come join the community now to be very clear the first and most important thing to do when you're world building an empire and you want it to be realistic is to study the accounts of real historical empires no not those ones this video will be only an introduction it would be impossible to truly answer this sort of question in totality it'll introduce relevant points and questions of contention but studying how real empires worked why they succeeded why they fell we'll give you the best possible brief and writing your own so communication one question to answer when thinking about your Empire is how quick and effective is its communication between the different governmental powers across the Empire between the government and its citizens and communication between citizens across distances which we'll get to in more detail on our part on control in empires biggest advantage against its smaller enemies within and without is its ability to draw on a larger population for its military more resources a diverse range of resources and intellectual minds for strategy and invention however this advantage can be nullified if you haven't researched husbandry I mean this advantage can be nullified if they can't effectively coordinate and communicate quickly with larger borders than a usual state quick and effective communication in the military is vital to bringing forces from across the state to combat its rivals one of the advantages of kuvira's earth Empire in Legion of Korra was its use of trains across the earth Kingdom this made communication between the provinces and central government with kuvira it's hid a lot easier forces could be quickly mobilized without the ability to efficiently coordinate resources during times of drought and famine it can easily lead to riots chaos and even rebellion the Roman Empire fell for a myriad of reasons but the strengthening of the urban centres outside Rome led to the central authority of Rome itself decreasing making the coordination of resources in the Western Roman Empire a lot more difficult as famine and plague struck the region it was less equipped to deal with it contributing to riots and its eventual sack finally communication to citizens is vital to the coordination of economic or governmental policy and its implementation legal reforms curfews new taxes the ability to spread propaganda which is surprisingly important or gather opinions and Democratic votes from across the state this is partly what they mean when they talk about the reason an empire fell is because they were stretched too thin they lost that ability to coordinate and efficiently communicate so munication is clearly important but how does your empire maintain this effective communication this will depend heavily on the context of your empire if your empire is land based in a low-tech world then consider the phrase all roads lead to Rome the Romans built a huge network of roads across the empire with communication and coordination in mind in a pseudo industrial era trains and Telegraph's become an incredibly important form of communication over distance in James sa Corey Slava thand wakes communication between Earth Mars and the belt is done by tightbeam this huge laser system across the solar system to transmit information now whatever the method of communication in your sci-fi or fantasy Empire be a technological or magical what really matters is the speed and amount of information that can easily travel this has two important effects on a the effectiveness of central government and be stability and the desire for self-governance we will get to that second effect in our part on control this is where we talk about how you should have at least five different town centers by the Imperial age I mean the wind world building an empire the speed and amount of information that can travel throughout it will determine how the institutional power is set up who reports to who where are they based what informations delivered how long do they take to respond and what decisions are they allowed to make based on that see empires are these huge cumbersome things with a thousand metaphorical tentacles and a million fingers in a million pies if all legal economic and policy decisions are made by a single institutionalized power like an emperor or supreme leader Mischka we're not only communication is slow but government powers can't send a lot of information very easily this can lead to inefficient government with more decisions to be made by that one body in the time to communicate to their decisions back and forth and inefficient communication least all the problems we previously discussed part of the success of Tiber Septim Serra Dalek Empire in the elderscrolls was that it recognized it would be inefficient to have an extremely strong central government that made all the decisions it's communication was too slow often on horseback and not enough information could easily travel to be an effective system as a result government became relatively decentralized while the emperor was the ultimate authority communication and decisions were and effective because provinces will largely live to make their own decisions provided they obeyed the law only a fraction of direct government was left to the impro and when things did go wrong and decisions were needed to be made by their central authority it was quickly decided because they weren't needing to manage the entire empire and was quickly communicated with the Emperor being situated in the geographical center of the Empire a great historical example of this is the Ching dynasty in China the centralized power was largely limited to war criminal proceedings Texas and some major industrial projects like waterways and bridges beyond that management was often quite local because we're communicating large amounts of information is slower a more decentralized government is often a more effective way of dealing with local issues like economic downturn property disputes or criminal proceedings in contrast quick and effective communication across the empire allows for a more centralized government now you might think this means that a successful empire in a fantasy series with swords and horses and carriages must have a decentralized power structure but some authors have actually used their magic system to subvert this expected set up in Santa Sion's way of Kings there's this thing called span reads which are a comparatively fast way of transmitting a large amounts of writing across great distances allowing decisions to be made from anywhere within the kingdom with speed by geometric system can affect how your empire governs and communicates in a number of other ways as well perhaps magicians can project their thoughts into the minds of citizens how would this affect your use of propaganda and would this make stopping the spread of rebellious ideas are harder with the Empire have to make sure that it hired all of these telepathic mages to work for it creating this class of elite propagandists in society it's important to consider how the fantastical elements of your story change how a government body would be administered if the abilities make certain duties easier or harder to carry out then this can make your empire more effective or give it a weak point for its enemies to exploit how quickly and effectively the government powers can respond to threats inside and outside the Empire is one links through which the author can develop a sense of sitting for the reader it's not just about military might what magical technological or administrative element of your Empire's communication means it is able to outmaneuver its enemies I mean aside from the damn Mongolian mounted Archer nothing secondly control while control is vital to the legitimacy of any government anywhere the vast land masses bearden continents or planets or whole galaxies that empires can preside over means the ability to assert that control is especially vital but what is control really it's easy to say collecting taxes is control but successfully collecting tax is often evidence of an empires control but it doesn't actually show how when Empire maintains that empires form obviously by absorbing different people groups into the same state and shockingly this can cause problems because some people don't like that because of this in terms of world building you as the writer have to ask why do people stay in the Empire why do they pay their taxes why do they not rebel most importantly how does the Empire the favorite answer of every evil empire in fiction is terror people obey because gulag but this raises more question than it really gives answers an empire based on terror can leave citizens feeling like rebellion is a better option and how do they keep a widespread expensive military presence that is repeatedly needing to be replenished and why do these people join the army anyway when they clearly think it's pretty evil where are they getting the army from empires that have historically ruled with pretty much nothing but terror have not lasted very long but we aren't talking about evil empires today that's more a writing trope that deserves an on writing video this is about realistic empires so history makes clear that successful empires often maintain control of groups they absorbed through peaceful or extortionate annexation or conquest by making it preferable for them to be in the Empire than outside of it it's easily the most effective way to this can be done in any number of ways in the case of the British Empire it was highly oppressive at times but the economic opportunity and access to world trade that are provided was attractive to many people in the states that had colonized under the Mongol Empire most citizens were secure and free to practice their own religion and Osiris the great citizens were free from the threat of slavery which you know is a bit of a low bar but it's a good bar to have for society what's critical as writers is that we show this within the narrative that we ground the Empire in a sense of realism in the experiences of everyday citizens in legend of korra we see that bolin joins the earth empire because it brings food and supplies in times of strife to towns who need it in the mote in god's eye Niven does this by scaling down his answer to the question in the experiences of the perspective character commander Roderick Blaine in leading an effort to put down a rebellion he sees what happens to societies that leave the Empire people stay loyal to it because without it society returns to economic collapse and disorder and security is a strong motivator for people to support the Empire but government control in an empire isn't just about your peeper king sweet potato ball murdered peasant in the case of dictatorships it's about keeping the people who keep you in power preferring to be part of your dictatorship than anyone elses different people at different levels of government and society have different reasons for preferring to be part of the Empire and the ruling body needs to account for that and multitude of groups that keep people in power in a multitude of ways maybe some are bribes some believe in security and some have a strong belief in the state religion there is a great video by CP G gray that I will link down in the description below that you should watch explaining this kind of concept in more depth why people join the Empire can also be intimately connected to your characters motivation why they assist the war effort and it's a common character arc and Dances with Wolves type stories like The Last Samurai to have these motivations challenged resulting in a character change like them leaving the Empire but those sort of stories are relatively common if you're looking for a more unique character arc perhaps they aren't part of the Empire but they go through a character change that makes them want to be a part of it but why people stay isn't just about making the Empire attractive sometimes it can be easier to make a not living in the Empire attractive like of the barbarians outside the Empire organized their farms like this and I mean propaganda we're talking about propaganda most authors will be aware of the oxymoronic Ministry of Truth in all wells in 1984 which kept the population under control by filtering the information available to them manufacturing crises and propagating stories about how awful or evil the outside Oceania is because of our recent historical relationship with propaganda particularly through the Nazis and the Soviet Union it's easy to imagine that any Empire that uses propaganda is automatically an evil empire type but propaganda has a long history as being a vital part of a successful Empire right back to Sargon of Akkad the ability of the government to control how their expansion is viewed by the populace is powerful we'll begin with a pop quiz on our great march of civilization what year did fire lord sozin battle the air nation army the air nomads didn't have a formal military sozin defeated them by ambush I don't know how you could possibly know more than our national history book like how the war against separatists is depicted in Star Wars Hasina's barbarians against freedom and liberty when in reality they were a lot more complex but propaganda does present a curious problem for writing characters especially if they're your protagonists who come from within the Empire why wouldn't your characters believe how it depicts the opposition or the military of everyone else does in the dragon prince the main character Kellum doesn't believe that all elves are really monsters and he doesn't really believe the war is justified but there isn't really a reason given as to why he doesn't while everyone else around him does a great example of doing propaganda well is Zuko from Avatar The Last Airbender he genuinely believes the Fire Nation is spreading prosperity to the world and it takes a long and difficult journey to see through that propaganda and approach the reality having in character easily see through their empires propaganda where others can't isn't bad writing but it can feel jarring for the reader if they think that the protagonists is just magically more intelligent or more moral than everyone else it can be more interesting to instead have them seeing the reality as part of their character change but it's also important to remember that propaganda becomes a less effective when people can freely research things for themselves either through magic or through technology and thus effective propaganda becomes increasingly more expensive for the state now within the question of asking why citizens don't rebelled two important concepts to consider as a world builder are self-governance and sovereignty how does your empire accommodate these two sentiments which have been forces of revolution all throughout history see people don't really like it when they're being ruled by people they don't know or they didn't choose or have any cultural or societal connections to maybe you do I don't know your finishes but groups of people who feel this tribalistic bond with one another usually wish to govern themselves as a tribal group in the modern day we share this tribalistic bond with those in the same state or nation or even continent but this presents a particular problem for Empires who by nature absorb a number of different tribalistic groups now in some fictional cases like the Dalek Empire self-governance isn't really an option and they rule through absolute terror but historically Terra hasn't really worked as a long-term administrative strategy no a more effective strategy is actually allowing a degree of self-governance Alexander the Great permitted rulers of conquered provinces to remain in their position as long as they paid their taxes and obeyed the law proclaim your loyalty if you wish to keep in your fictional Empire this could mean maybe not slopping the hit off the king that the people of a certain conquered province really love appointing one of the local noble houses as governors or creating a local democratic body that's subordinate to the central authority or emperor but it's still allowed to make decisions or maybe giving them the full rights of citizens rather than being enslaved because people tend to prefer not being enslaved what matters above all is that when people feel that when issues around their home are raised they're actually heard and addressed with decentralized government they're far more equipped to deal with local problems it helps for that feeling of self-governance over their own lands and a fierce even if they're technically ruled by some far-off Emperor but this in mind they are less likely to rebel and more likely to but finally this is where we talk about what communication between citizens and the second effect of the speed and amount of communication means for control stability and the desire for self-governance so superior sci-fi technology or advanced magic can make communication over long distances extremely fast like a sounds act like phones and scents elantris or the Stargate technology of the Ancients in sg-1 allows instant digital communication across light-years through wormholes this means that firstly if the urgency isn't necessarily there if the central power can immediately receive information immediately receive a lot of things and immediately decide they don't have the same practical motivation to decentralize as an empire would when communication is slow but more importantly in these worlds where information easily travels the notion of self-governance really begins to change as what people consider their community changes the people they have that tribalistic bond to it seems to mean more than just their village and that witch who lives in that hovel down by the river they can feel connected to their whole state their whole nation and maybe one day the entire planet in the case of galactic senate's and the like the result of accelerated communication between citizens is that people are often willing to accept a higher level of centralized power because it's still self-governance as long as that authority comes from their now wider community that they consider themselves a part of but even an economically sound an attractive Empire where you don't have to be a slave will have its insurgents the ungrateful sods whose greatest advantage in rebellion is the ability to strike quickly with a larger border and land mass a vital element of control is being able to respond to threats within and without swiftly if an empire can't mobilize forces quickly then it effectively gives the insurgents time to rebel and set up an effective defense by which time you're essentially fighting an independent state this is closely connected to the communication fates as we spoke about before in the case of sci-fi empires that spanned planets or whole galaxies this really becomes a problem when enemies are light-years or half a galaxy away what is truly preventing people from repeatedly rebelling solving this problem is partly why the Protoss Empire from Starcraft was so effective using warp gates they could teleport troops anywhere around the Empire throughout the galaxy nullifying the advantage that any resistance would have in assembling quickly likewise the Mongol Empire was known for how swiftly it can move forces are taking days or weeks earlier than expected and the Romans built a whole network of roads to aim Swift troop movement throughout the Empire another method which is funnily enough often underrated when it comes to writing and world building is assimilation this is helping absorbed people's wish to stay a part of the Empire by creating a unifying cultural identity that they can be a part of this is often done in two ways a imposing an ideology this is commonly a religion like we see in Warhammer 40k they have to recognize the imperial cult as their religion or die likewise the early rashidun caliphate made it preferable for those who chose to be Muslim or be introducing unifying cultural practices one example of this is Rome and how they created the Coliseum with this in mind it created a cultural tradition in sport that all people could get behind and appreciate creating unifying activities or imposing certain cultural practices on absorbed peoples creates a new cultural identity for the whole Empire the more engrained these practices become in some cases they can help people feel part of the Empire however making these practices too cumbersome can also have the opposite effect and be oppressive and finally let's talk about everyone's favorite topic economics you know I say they're sarcastically but like eighty thousand of you people watched a video on cabbage economics so what you doing man what you're doing with your life so commerce economic stability of a given area is one of the greatest indicators of crime rebellion and peace and there is a good reason for that it's not that people aren't concerned with what their country is doing overseas or how much corruption there is at higher levels of government but if they have a good job a stable income and prospects for the future then they are more likely to turn a blind eye not even kidding there's a whole Wikipedia page dedicated to people writing over bread to the average squalor in peasant it matters less to them whether their tax money is heading to Narnia or the Teletubbies Parliament it's just another person going King and Commerce is closely connected to communication as well one of the big advantages of having an empire is that it creates an opportunity for a wider market to buy and sell to with often lower tariffs well some of the time and the ability to communicate easily at distance makes trading easier the market more competitive meaning that overall people tend to be more economically prosperous though the caveat to this should be that empires are also often based on bringing wealth back to the homeland so it doesn't necessarily mean that all people are always better off but in creating a working and successful Empire the government has a bigger role than just not taxing people to death to draw on John Locke's two treatises of government a large reason that people want to be part of the civil state in this case the Empire is that it protects property and facilitates trade this can be done in any number of ways the chain Tennessee distributed licensed traders to help the populace know who to trust the romans stamped goods like oils to officiate than when they were shipped throughout the empire to help people know when they were being tricked and the ability to take claims against another individual in a fair court system is critical to a free functioning economy and the sad thing is is that there really aren't many examples of fictional empires being shown to facilitate and protect trade the cyrillic empire and the other schools does pretty much everything that the ancient Romans did but nothing unique if you're looking to distinguish your empire from others infection then perhaps showing how your Empire deals with Commerce would help establish it as a more realistic Empire through a relatively unique lens it would establish why people prefer to be a part of it why are there survived and what it does that other states around it don't one thing to be aware of though as a writer when world-building realistic empires is change empires change constantly one relatively good example of this on the larger scale possible is the Imperium of man in Warhammer 40k this million planets wide Empire is so big that it barely holds together there's opposition to the council of terror widespread rebellion and the Horus heresy the whole system of government was destroyed in the great scouring and it's military and economy was repeatedly collapsing being formed and reformed territory being lost and gained and split between different powers and factions within the Empire overall it could hardly be called a contiguous Empire for all it changed likewise the Roman Empire is often imagined as this cohesive and stable political body but to be honest its history is so tumultuous its culture was constantly changing that the people at the top and the bottom switching around the economy shifting and its focus and aims changing there is no single arc to its history it has repeated trials collapses and Reformation all throughout its time history is never simple an empires are nearly never perfectly stable to put it simply history is complicated empires go through changes in borders religion politics economy and culture and it's important to show this change in the environment with evidence of the past perhaps there are monuments to figures of an old predominant religion that has since died off or the architecture of the marketplaces meant to facilitate an old kind of trade the Empire no longer needs perhaps the roads are built to reach certain mines which have since run dry if the empire begins to lose any of these things that we've discussed then it's more likely to fracture and collapse it's important to keep in mind how the events of the story also affect each of these things how it affects the Empire's operation if there are belly in destroys what they see as a vital target to communication but the reader sees no change in the Empire's ability to coordinate its forces or resources or government then it can feel like there was no real consequence to that dramatic beat the actions of the characters in the story should actually affect the Empire so what have we discussed today firstly the speed and amount of communication across an empire is vital to effective coordination this can be altered by magic or technology slower communication often result in decentralized power secondly it's important to consider how the magic system affixed how government works and the challenges it faces thirdly an empire can establish control through terror making it preferable to be a part of it propaganda about the outside allowing self-governance creating feeling of sovereignty and assimilation the capacity to mobilize troops quickly is crucial to control fourthly a healthy economy is an indicator of stability within an empire and a wider market may make its citizens better off than those outside the Empire successful empires often protect property rights and facilitate trade theft Lee empires change and culture economy politics and religious makeup and it can help with realism for its description to reflect that but that is all for me I know another horrendously long video and there's gonna be a part two it's because turns out that making videos about how empires work and rise and fall is kind difficult you're essentially summarizing all of human history next time we'll be discussing how umpires rise and fall question of the day which is your favorite historical Empire and why I'm terribly cliche but I love the Roman Empire I just look at it and who can possibly resist to that military formation

      "huh so remember how I said this would be a two-part of thing and we discuss how empires rise and fall in just one video well about that and this is just gonna be on how empires rise and you'll get a part 3 on how they fall hopefully you don't mind what causes the rise of an empire well you need a thousand food an eight hundred go to stuff but that's not the point last video we discussed what makes an empire work what prevents it from collapsing communication control and commerce link up in the corner to watch but today we'll be discussing how our glorious empires rise and like how hard could that possibly be to summarize so the rise of an empire logically win world building your empire you have to figure out its shape which planets is that centered on why does it expand to certain kingdoms but not others where are its borders and what is its primary motivation for empire building any number of factors are involved here but we'll be looking at three important forces that lead to different kinds of empires resource security and nationalism as before this video is brought to you at the wonderful suggestion of one of my absolutely amazing patrons who is actually doing his thesis in this kind of stuff so he holds me right to the script this sort of educational content takes me longer to make than my usual server takes a whole week and I love doing it and it would mean the world if you find this stuff helpful for your writing if you would help me do that for just a couple of dollars a month on my patreon there is a link to that down in the description below I would love you to come join our discord community it's an amazing little place we talk about writing and world building all the time come join us I like to reiterate - the most important thing about world building empires study the accounts of real historical empires why they rose what sustained to them and why they fell they will be the best possible education that you can have this video will raise some important points and questions but studying real empires is vital to having a realistic foundation to your own fictional one firstly resources needing or wanting resources is a major motivation for empire building maybe they need food wood stone or gold please and this setup gives us two points of guidance in constructing your imp firstly this gives you a geographical map of where your empire will be trying to exert force this includes considering the geography and landmass of the homeland itself which resources doesn't your homeland have that it needs or wants and where does have those resources Portugal wants a valuable dyes woods as well as spices that it didn't have access to itself where did have all that Brazil secondly this will help determine the way in which your empire exerts force through resource control in doing so it often has an economic backbone if your fictional world economy runs on a naval trade then the Empire would naturally desire a strong Navy and its strategy would revolve around controlling crucial ports around the world if your sci-fi world has an emphasis on space trade routes or there are particular trading planets then controlling them is crucial for establishing a viable Empire that can acquire resources this is partly why chorus n't and the star wars series was so vital to control it's an important planet at the end of a dozen space trading routes but on how they go about it well sometimes resource motivated empires don't rely on overt hostile military invasion they acquire trade deals they impose taxes on their exports tariffs on their imports and extract to enrich the homeland even if backed up by there's gun that was lent from the National Rifle Association this was well partly what Britain was famous for doing in India New Zealand Canada Kenya and its other colonies now in contrast to empires focus could be on eliminating trade it doesn't control control of the Silk Road connecting the east and the west was critical to controlling the economy of the Mongolian Empire but in the early days Genghis Khan destroyed a number of southern Arabian and Turkish cities to eliminate trade routes that he couldn't easily control trade was forced to go through his one Silk Road ensuring his economic predominance now one underestimated fetter in the way in empire expands is climate the British Empire usually brought legal traditions courts and Parliament to the places they colonized but they quickly discovered that the hot climate of Kenya and the other African colonies was intolerable and deadly with a huge host of diseases that they simply couldn't quite realizing this their focus switched from colonization to extraction primarily just taking resources to enrich the homeland with the people of an empire have no real interest in colonizing a land that Empire takes for its resources they may resort to an extraction strategy rather than a more amicable strategies we discussed just before this is often more brutal to those living there as it doesn't necessarily bring with that the legal structures that citizens would usually be entitled to this is often caused by how inhospitable the climate or the environment is by trying to build an empire in the map Arabia however this is by no means a universal rule and it most commonly applies to resource driven empires but there are a whole host of other factors that play into how they could treat these lands one notable factor in considering these two points is how big you want the land mess of your empires homeland be generally smaller home lands have fewer and less diverse resources meaning they are more likely to be resource driven than large estates think Great Britain Portugal and the Dutch Empire a word fractured into islands and archipelagos like leg winds wizard of Earthsea may be more likely to have resource driven empires arise in it the fire nation from Avatar The Last Airbender is actually a relatively good example of most of this their comparatively small size means that resources are a crucial element of their expansion strategy their need for the cold wood and iron rich deposits of the northwestern earth Kingdom determined the shape of the fire Empire at the beginning of the war this area was a priority for them to colonize and control beyond to this knowing that the world economy is largely in a naval trade they build a strong Navy and focused on controlling port cities within the earth Kingdom to manipulate trade and impose taxes that could enrich the homeland however there is an inverse version of this where the homeland controls the majority or monopolizes an extremely valuable resource that other nations require this helps determine two things the monopoly may help determine the political structure of the Empire a great example of this is how a wreck a sand Frank Herbert's dune is the only place in the universe that has the resource spice which is described in a fashion that without it there is no Commerce the Empire there is no civilization he who controls it controls our destiny seriously it's practically just an empire built on space cocaine the result of this is that it becomes the capital of the Atreides Empire the powers that be naturally center around controlling their resource which has become so valuable other powerful factions like the been ages are it and the guild navigators of the spacing guild also ensure they have representatives on Arrakis the center of power because of that resource this monopoly may help determine the shape of the Empire as it is driven to preserve itself against those who would wish to take that precious resource though we'll get more to this on our part on security and if you're looking for a unique set up for your story about an empire then this may be it it's more than that empires are seen as extraction Estelle theory and economy of a homeland is heavily related to the control and trade of a certain resource then those who control their results will naturally wield power in any empire that comes from that either directly and a monarch achill feudal sense or indirectly by influencing those in power it may create a cultural economic and political center for the Empire and that set up could be really fascinating to play with as you look into the meccans of those in power controlling this resource and like considering which resources your homeland has and which resources it needs gives shape to an empire by determining where in your fictional universe it will assert its power it also helps determine how it will go about doing so by manipulating trade colonization or extraction ownership and location of these valuable resources within an empire can also affect its political structure a second major reason that empires form is security this is both in why certain people groups across an area join together and in how they acquire new land in the fallout of wars against neighboring kingdoms States planets or galaxies the early Romans are a great example of both of these they were a bunch of disconnected villagers positioned at a strategic point along the Tiber River this position attracted the attention from Latins say binds Vulcans and Etruscans as a result this collection of villages were forced to band together to form a city-state so they form together for security and after their victories over the Etruscan city of a the neighboring city of tusculum the Romans subsumed their land and incorporated the defeated inhabitants into this state growing the size of the empire some empires establish a foothold in the lands of people who attack them as a security measure to ensure their enemies will not attack them again this grows your glorious empire and in the same way that resource driven empires are given shape by where the resources are security based empires are given shape by defensible borders mountains canyons coastlines or the deep Ardennes Forest - that no army could possibly need and in play maybe more motivated by security depending on the geography of their homeland for example the Mongolian homeland across the Eurasian steppe elects a naturally defensible coastline and doesn't have an easily defensible southern border with the Chinese to the south and the Turks to the west to secure his homeland Genghis Khan brought the surrounding nations to heel to establish more defensible borders create a secure position for US homeland with a huge buffer zone as well as prevent the Turks and Chinese from rising against him again and within this while a resource Empire may more often arise from small nations or islands large or land-based nations with our coastlines especially those that are landlocked may often be more driven by security with less naturally defensible borders the Britannian Empire in code geass is an interesting mix and it's beginning its shape is determined by a need for security it conquered its neighbors in the Americas as a means to protect itself and create a more robust resistance to enemy empires around it but as the rare material Sakura died became more valuable in the war it decided to conquer Japan where it could be found employers don't just conquer places randomly they choose them for specific reasons here being security or resources however people groups don't just unite under a single figurehead for mutual security against external threats but also internal threats like lawlessness and bandits and you're the bandits who have been causing chaos where I am trying to establish order being a single political entity means that the roads and areas between cities can be more effectively protected and policed making both travel and trade easier within their borders and we discussed how Commerce leads to prosperity stability and peace in an empire last video it's also no longer up to just one town to deal with those damn wolves murdering my I mean a third major reason for the formation of an empire is nationalism and before we get into this I want to remind you that history is complicated nationalism is a complex ideology with caveats and different interpretations that mean it would be reductionist to just call it good bad evil or oppressive it's also thought of as a relatively modern concept but nationalism in one form or another can be seen all throughout history even if it wasn't called that what I mean to say is that we aren't just talking about Nazis okay they were nationalists but they aren't the only nationalists so nationalism is a strange creature that can equally arise out of strife and prosperity the Republic or later Galactic Empire is one example of nationalism that arose out of strife a galaxy-wide war economic downturn and fear of losing their way of life and traditions the response to this is a nationalistic wave in hopes of us [Music] becoming an empire is seen as a way to prevent that decay on the other hand we see how the fire nation's nationalism arises out of prosperity our nation is enjoying an unprecedented time of peace and wealth our people are happy we should share this prosperity with the rest of the world in our hands is the most successful Empire in history it's time we expanded it the desire to build an empire doesn't come from fear of loss of the way of life but out of this righteous belief that their way of life is bitter and thus they have a right to spread it across the rest of the world but nationalism naturally enters the narrative of a story in a curious way that the other forces don't a desire for resources or security isn't necessarily as personal to your everyday lumberjack villager number three it was the Plutonian military who needed the resource sakuradite and security on the border is usually dealt with by the Gov in contrast nationalism is a force that permeates the mindset of everyday citizen on a very personal level now it's easy to show how nationalistic your empire is through banners everywhere and giant group gatherings that totally aren't the Nuremberg rally but it can be more effective to show your nationalism through how your characters think it's their traditions that are dying out it's their philosophy that is superior it's their economy that is so much damn better than the states around them they've got plenty of reserve supplies luxuries are readily available and they've already researched looms so they're practically immortal this was very much the case when it came to the expansion of the early Islamic caliphates where they had a strong economy and academic culture that led to revolutions and science and mathematics for the day but they also had a unifying religion that they believed others should adhere to as well they had a belief in a duty to spread that to the rest of the world nationalism revolves around traditions philosophies religions and ways of life that people value and care about on a deep and personal level it's important to keep in mind how that can play into their character motivations their relationships between those who come from their nationalism and those who don't and societal functions like how they would want their education system to run this also presents a challenge for writers where they have protagonists who grew up within a possibly racist sexist or condescending cultural environment of their empire why do they not adhere to this nationalistic ideology or the racist or sexist undertones that come with it when everyone else around them does often there isn't a good reason given they're just inexplicably naturally more moral or intelligent elta the last airbender does a great job of this with Zuko he did grow up in a nationalistic state and it takes a difficult and long personal transformation for him to break down those preconceptions and a merger new he's not just magically bitter but let's talk about the political structure behind nationalism it's totally understandable to think that nationalism must lead to fascism with recent historical experiences like Hitler and Mussolini and uh wow that that's a lot of fascist movements but an absolute fascist leader doesn't necessarily follow a rise in nationalism Gandhi was one such example of Indian nationalism not leading to fascism what is true is that because nationalistic movements have incredibly and personal motivations it does often center around a single leader who embodies and encourages those sentiments Napoleon was loved by many as someone who championed the values of the French Revolution while Hitler advocated for German values which included duty industry discipline law sovereignty and order things they felt they were losing in the wake of World War one even so with or without this absolute figure at the head of government nationalism does tend to result in a more centralized power structure in Harry till doves timeline one nine one series the fascist freedom party seized power over waterways - they used economic planning and they worked to undermine states rights and to their power to create laws in favor of their leaders central authority this is a pattern that we see in real fetor states as well the government wanting to enforce a single law single culture a single way of life in hopes of defending it across the entire state and that requires a local government to have less power to ensure that they cannot undermine that a nationalistic Empire does provide for a slightly different writing opportunity though with a slightly different focus for the tension in the narrative nationalists ticket buyers have an internal focus on creating the single culture and single law for the homeland what happens to those who are part of the homeland but don't conform history ranges from expulsion to pogroms to the Holocaust but how would your empire deal with this internal conflict it's not just concerned with the colonies or those at conkers nationalistic empires often result in fascist governments with a single person at its center but this is not required they also usually result in centralized power but this in turn causes the issues that we discussed around communication and control last video which can destabilize the Empire a nationalistic Empire also allows for a focus more on the citizens of the homeland who do or don't conform while resource security empires often focus more on the conflict between those in and out of the homeland those are three important motivations for empire building but how do they actually accomplish it you might want to build an empire but I'm sorry to break this to you you need more than just hopes and dreams let's talk about one factor to consider technological advantage by which I mean those damn elite English longbowmen I mean the Romans conquered the tribes of Europe with ease through superior military tactics in 1453 the Ottoman Empire conquered Constantinople due to a huge technological advantage kennen's that could bring down the usually defensible walls the British outmatched native groups were the muskets a great fictional example of this is the fire nation with their industrialized economies steam-powered ships and mechanized siege weapons the earth kingdom didn't stand a chance the Galactic Sandby via licensed steel world brought humanity into its empire under threat of its hellburner weapons you know sci-fi is full of Empires you conquer using superior technology rather than tactics it's often just this boardroom of people going right what's our next plan our last laser machine was destroyed hang on what about a bigger laser give that man a raise if the focus of your narrative is on the conflict who empires in the in technological imbalance can be a complicating factor well example of this is that the expansion of the rashidun caliphate was temporarily slowed by the walled cities of the nile delta for a while they didn't have the siege weapons or technology to easily take those cities on that terrain in your writing the question becomes how does the Empire evolve to deal with this or does it back down technological imbalance will help determine the shape of the Empire they will often go to places they can easily take with their superior tech or tactics rather than face down against an enemy who can fight them on equal ground if your empire has managed to subsume more technologically advanced peoples then itself then the reader may wonder why so what have we discussed today firstly empires are often driven by resources where certain resources are found determines where they can expand to the type of economy helps determined how they do so and climate and geography of the homeland are both factors to consider controlling a valuable resource may also give a natural center to the empire secondly empires are often driven by security and uniting their people or taking over enemy lands to protect themselves defensible borders buffer zones for the homeland and strategic points of control may help determine to where their empire expands to these are often more land based or landlocked than islands it is also a measure of ensuring internal security thirdly empires are often driven by nationalism in the wake of strife or prosperity it's important to show this mentality in the minds of everyday citizens and this presents a challenge for Abbott aganist who grew up with it and it may more easily allow for a narrative that focuses on internal tensions it often results in fascism but it does not need to fourthly empires nearly always have a tactical or technological advantage against those that they absorb but that is part two and I'll be back with a discussion around why your Empire failed later in

      "how you start your novel is one of the most important decisions that you will ever make as a writer be it the proverbial hook that you use the opening line or the point of view you write from but let's consider whether you should use a prologue you know one of those things that are literary nerds forget into five fights over on poetry night but first a big thank you to Squarespace who are sponsoring this video with whom I've built my own website linked down below where you can actually find two these scripts the notes for this video plus the notes for a few other videos think of them

your first purchase more on them later as always the best way to begin your novel will vary depending on your style your genre and your personal creative choices I'm not here to tell you how you should write your novel but there are some ways of doing prologues that work better than others in terms of engaging the reader a prologue is a segment of the story that takes place before the first chapter and the defining feature of a prologue is usually its distance from the main narrative this might be because of a point of view it's told from the perspective of a different character to the main story like in the way of kings by Brandon Sanderson be time it takes place significantly after or before the main narrative like in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone which takes place 10 years prior or see geography it takes place in a vastly different setting to the majority of the narrative like an altered carbon today we'll be discussing Hookes necessity backstory exposition unique tone mood or theme and length firstly hooks having both a prologue and a first chapter usually means that you have two hooks at the beginning of your book two big questions that you introduce to your reader the challenge with this double hook structure is the prologue hook can undermine the tension arising from the hook in the first chapter this is because some authors use the prologue to explain a mysterious element of the story imagine for example if Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince used a prologue hook that explicitly depicted Snape making the unbreakable vow to kill dumbledore if Draco could not do it then in the first chapter the hook was Harry suspecting that Draco and Snape are up to something there are two problems here firstly the reader would already know what Draco and Snape were up to meaning that the hook in the first chapter carries no weight secondly it makes the prologue pointless if the reader was going to wonder what Draco and Snape were up to by the first chapter then the prologue is just slowing down the reader getting to that point so instead when using this double hook structure it's important to have each hook target a different question in the narrative Rowling understood this and in the half-blood Prince Snape's prologue leaves the reader wondering what has Snape promised to do if draco can't while the first chapter has nothing to do with that instead it starts off with the Dumbledore offering to take Harry on a secret mission leaving the reader wondering what has Dumbledore planning now these two hooks eventually become somewhat connected but that's not all whale ATAR in the book as a side note I really encourage you to watch my video on writing the first chapter where we discuss the three-act structure opening lines and the hook in far more detail so your prologue hook might be distinct from the first chapters but it's important to consider the type of hook as well the advantage of a prologue is it lets you write from a different character's point of view or at a different time or in a different place this means that they are often used to depict pivotal scenes crucial to the development of the tension of the story that the characters in the main narrative couldn't possibly be aware of for example in a game of Thrones the prologue is written from the perspective of a night's watchman and it depicts the mysterious others far north of the wall murdering a number of the Nights Watch raising wildlings from the dead and playing Tetris with their bodies this tells the reader that there are fantastical elements coming and B it introduces the threat that one of the main characters Jon will face but cannot be aware of yet as the supernatural threat doesn't even appear until chapter 52 500 pages into the story instead at the beginning it's this medieval realism and John is neither at the wall nor does he know what's going on there so it'll be incredibly difficult to introduce the supernatural threat in the main narrative without dropping awkward exposition of so did you hear about how there's like I some bees lull so so undid the prologue hook should be something that cannot be effectively communicated early in the main narrative because either the main characters cannot know about it or suspected but is still crucial to the development of the tension later in the story secondly necessity the prologue is the first experience that the reader has of your story meaning it's even more critical for you to consider why is this segment necessary to read something you should actually ask about every part of your story by the way one bad example of a necessary prologue is in John Green's Paper Towns where we get a scene in the past of Quentin and Margo finding a dead body in the park now the scene is crucial because of one particular line lots of people get divorces and don't kill themselves I said I think I maybe know why she finally said why maybe all the strings inside and broke she said this line introduces the metaphor of the strings that Greene repeatedly references throughout the book it's even the title of one third of the book without showing the reader where this metaphor comes from and Margo's way of thinking we wouldn't be able to as accurately grasp the themes and how Quinton thinks about Margo which is a massive part of the story the information given in this prologue is immediately relevant to the readers understanding of the story its themes and the way that it is presented is far more visceral than if we were just told about this experience from when they were kids but let's talk about something that I know a lot of people are concerned with when writing a prologue character backstory and specifically when and whether it's necessary in a prologue so it can be tempting to go hey my character has this a traumatic past and that that matters and will make them care about it so here you go reader but ya know most of the time back story has been a given as a flashback later in the story or woven in through creative exposition meaning you should go straight to chapter 1 and just jump in this is because a lot of the time that event in their past does and help the reader understand the beginning of your novel it's relatively disconnected for example let's consider which elements of character backstory Neil Gaiman gives us in his prologue to the fantastic book Stardust one of my favorites the prologue doesn't tell us that Tristan is the son of the long-lost princess of Stormhold instead it focuses on Tristan's father going to the magical land of fairy the use of character backstory here is effective because it only shows us the things that help us better understand restaurants motivations and mindset as a character we see where he got his curiosity for the land of fairy from his father explaining that he's the long-lost heir to the throne has a place in the overall story but it's entirely irrelevant to understanding the first chapter because Tristan doesn't even know it Diamond didn't include this because it's disconnected from the beginning of his story another example to think about is altered carbon which shows Takeshi covet in his old body and depicts how he was captured the use of this piece of character backstory works because the first episode shows Takeshi waking up in a new body this creates a juxtaposition between the prologue and first chapter seeing the same character in two bodies is jarring for both the viewer and the character and it really helps us understand the fundamental premise of the story that people can shift their consciousness into a new body in both of these examples a backstory prologue is only used insofar as it helps us understand the first chapter or the beginning of the story what makes a prologue necessary is that it introduces an element fundamental to understanding the novel from that point forward in a far more impactful way when it comes to a backstory prologue it can be important to only introduce elements immediately relevant to understanding the first chapter things relevant far later on on the story can be left from the main narrative otherwise it risks the prologue feeling disconnected thirdly exposition one of the major criticisms that editors agents writers publishers readers have of prologues is that they're just exposition dumps particularly in sci-fi or fantasy depicting how a sword was made or how the Dark Lord was originally defeated or how the grand Stargate system was set up or how this space potatoes came to rule the Empire basically it's a law dump about your world's history and politics and laws and magic system would you find fascinating but no one else does I mean it's just a law dump and who would like who would just read law dumps and just just law books about the world and really boring academic historical language a man oh man I'd never do that Oh baby appendix B tail of the years in the year 1000 Sarah lund alarmed by the growing power of the nÃºmenÃ³reans chooses Mordor as a land to make a stronghold he begins building bare adder pointers I'm the exception most people don't find that stuff inherently interesting I really recommend watching the two-part series I have on delivering exposition effectively but I'm not just going to tell you to not have exposition in your prologue like so many other videos and articles seen too instead we're going to talk about two ways to actually weave exposition in mystery and emotionalism firstly or three a mystery in Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone chapter one is really more of a prologue it's written from a different perspective to the main character and it's it a long time in the past it functionally communicates a bunch of exposition though like a that the Dark Lord has been defeated be that his name is Voldemort see that Lily and James are did and D that there is a wizarding world out there of magical people's hidden from muggles sight that have been fighting a war for years but Rowling communicates all of this with an air of mystery they're saying you tried to kill the Potter son Harry but he couldn't he couldn't kill that little boy no one knows why or how but they're saying that when he couldn't kill Harry Potter Voldemort's power somehow broke and that's why he's gone there's a lot of unknowns in this first chapter weird things happening that communicate only parts of the full exposition it creates this mysterious half-finished puzzle for the reader where they are more focused on the questions they have than the exposition they're actually given as opposed to being told things with absolute certainty secondly or 3b emotionalism in George RR Martin's a dance of dragons the prologue features a wounded broken Vera Mia a skin-changer like Bren now Martin spins most of this chapter actually just developing Vera mere as a character giving us insights into his motivations what he hates about his life his failures how he remembers dying nine times how that felt and how exhausted and drained he now feels the reader is drawn into the experiences of Vera mere this weird character this guy with a life of very strange experiences the focus of the story is on his hopes his fears and his eventual acceptance of death but at the same time Martin communicates a hell of a lot of vital exposition about how the powers of skin changes actually work have a contrived them man to being stuck in an animal's body for too long how you can lose your humanity how you can become too weak to jump into another's mind and how those strong enough can actually cast you out these things become important in brains storyline later on as he delves into this magic in the case of both Harry Potter and a dance with dragons the author's only communicate the vital things they want us to know Rowling doesn't talk about the 1692 statute of Wizarding secrecy she talks about the one vital event that defines Harry's life Martin uses a whole story to communicate some vital things that explain problems that bran has to face and elements of his magic system do not use prologues as a means to dump exposition about your world or its law prologue exposition should be limited to a few vital pieces of information this can be done through creating a mystery by giving only pieces of unexplained but interesting law or through emotionalism by contextualizing that law to the characters emotional experiences fourthly a unique tone mood or theme that isn't easy to communicate in the first chapter for example James sa Corey spoke a Leviathan wakes uses its prologue to distinguish his science fiction novel as a mystery Lovecraftian horror story something that's not all that common in mainstream science fiction a torture chamber then tubes ran through the ship like a thing or Airways part of it pulsed flesh an outcropping of the thing towards her captain Darren's hid help me it said that last line is the only piece of dialogue at all creating this creepy gloomy silence for the reader in the prologue it's heavy on descriptive language and too lingers on those things that the reader finds most unsettling this revolting flesh abomination this Lovecraftian horror feel wouldn't be as easy to communicate in the first chapter which features a lighter tone with friendly characters without the biohazard stuff we see here if your story has an unconventional theme mood or tone that will hook the reader and it cannot be effectively established in the first chapter then a prologue may be useful focus on language and description that highlights that unique feature of your story but don't confuse using your prologue to establish a unique tone mood or theme with using the prologue to have an exciting opening to your book that the first chapter cannot provide if that's the reason for you having a prologue then change your first chapter it should be exciting by itself agents and editors are very aware of this trick and finally length in terms of how long a prologue should be most agents and editors advise for it to be short much shorter than your average chapter for example in Avatar The Last Airbender the prologue is only one minute and 17 seconds long when the average chapter is about 22 minutes long ha you didn't think I was gonna be able to fit this one in because there's barely a prologue in Avatar The Last Airbender but I will make it work if I have to you can have your prologue as a page or even just a couple of paragraphs it really doesn't have to be that long as a fun exercise let's consider the prologue from Eragon which I realize many of you might love I did too as a kid it was my favorite book I read it like 13 times but let's think about it critically it depicts Arya being cornered by the shade Durza and in her sending the egg west where Eragon finds it does this book have two distinct hooks well not really the question of the prologue is what is this magical sapphire stone which give the cover isn't even though much of a mystery and the question we ask an arrogance first chapter is what is this magical sapphire stone is the prologue necessary well it tells us that Doozer and I are out there but not much more if anything it's somewhat demystifies the dreams that Eragon has later on in the book so when Eragon finds out who it is all shocked the reader is just like oh who could have guessed to be fair it's not an exposition dump but it doesn't really communicate much more than who does or is really and does or isn't even that interesting well then doesn't perhaps communicate a unique tone mood or theme this is partly why the prologue and Eragon is criticized it may communicate the traditional tolkien-esque feel to the story but this doesn't communicate anything that the reader isn't expecting we sort of have an underlying assumption that fantasies will be like that unless we're told otherwise all of this is a lot of information to take down I know so I would like to thank today's sponsor Squarespace who helped me build my own website where you can find it this script as well as a number of others as research notes for you when you go to write your own prologue if you are interested in building your own website then Squarespace has turned out pretty damn great for me it's easy to use for any kind of artist writer photographer or whatever else you might be and I found it super easy to use easy to get handle on but someone who isn't that great with website building by itself and it has 24/7 365 day support for those who want it if you want to start building your own website to try my Squarespace link that's kind of important to help you along with that you will get 10% off your first purchase with them and if you just go to Squarespace com so tell a future me or click the link in the description you can start building your own that Squarespace comm such hello future me to get started today link down in the description so what have we discussed today firstly have hooks that target two different points of tension in the narrative in the prologue and first chapter if used that hook should be something unable to be communicated through the experiences of the main characters secondly a prologue must be necessary backstory prologues are generally if they only provide backstory insofar as it helps the reader understand the very first chapter or at least the beginning of the story thirdly avoid prologues that our exposition dumps we've exposition in through emotionalism and mystery fourthly prologues can be used to communicate a unique tone mood or theme that can't be effectively demonstrated in the first chapter ultimately don't do a prologue unless it's necessary and you can do it well but at the same time write the story that you want to tell maybe it might not be the best storytelling technique maybe it might make it a little bit of a drag at the beginning but if that is the story that you want to write then your only responsibility as a writer is to do that you're not obligated to stick up to these standards that people hold up online I'm just here to try and give some thoughts for you to consider but that is all from me my question what happens in your prologue why does it work if you used one and if you haven't what would your prologue be like let me know down in the comments below in the meantime come follow me over on Twitter I'm highlighting that one especially because that is the one that I use the most pretty much I've very rarely post to Facebook and stuff come follow me there you can ask me questions I'm usually pretty responsive or it try to be if you want to support the channel with a sort of educational content I've got my patreon link down below you've heard all this before anyways I hope you enjoyed this little video on prologues I've always had weird feelings about them because I really like them but a lot of people really hate them anyways have a good evening day morning whatever time it is for you stay nerdy and I will see you in the future you\n",

      "today's video is sponsored by Kemp fire a writing program that we will be reviewing later so I'm not saying that we're going to spend the whole video talking about literally the best mentor character to ever exist fight me uncle IRA mentor ask I'm a scary face but we primarily explore the mental character through their relationship to the protagonist and to ensure that they function within the narrative we will mostly examine one critical element of their role the character arc catalyst we're going to split this into ten parts kind of incite emotional difference mentors and negative arcs the action reaction scene the emotional position scene the Ã©lysÃ©e in action scene humanizing mental characters design and killing mental characters so by nature the mentor character espouses some form of insight that the protagonist does not yet know but what kind of insight do they need to have in CHEM Whelan's fantastic book creating character arcs a good point she makes is that at the heart of any character arc is the lie he is harboring some deeply held a misconception about either himself the world or probably both your character may not even realize he has a problem what matters in writing a mentor character is the relationship they have to that lie the protagonist believes and the role of that relationship will change depending on whether the character has a positive arc changing for the better or a negative one changing for the worse in a positive arc the mentor has specific insight into the truth that the protagonist does not yet believe in the last airbender Zuko believes that his self-worth and his honor comes from the approval of his abusive manipulative domineering father he doesn't even realize that this is a problem the only way to regain my honor is to find the avatar he sees it as the truth this is the lie he believes and it is the one that Iroh struggles to break down I know my own destiny uncle is it your own destiny or is it a destiny someone else has tried to force on you I have to do this I'm begging you Prince Zuko it's time for you to begin asking yourself the big questions who are you and what do you want but IRA doesn't just espouse the odd piece of wisdom relevant to the plot like him from the dungeon master nor does he know the answer to everything in the story no the relationship dynamic he has with Zuko works so well because it is very particular Iroh has a specific and important truth about life critical to Zuko's character rock that your destiny is your own and you are honorable because of how you act and not because others approve of you and the kind of insight they have relates to our second topic emotional difference the specificity of their insight is important because it is what makes the mint or dynamic effective in sight seems Hollow and licit characterizes major emotional differences between the protagonist and the mentor where Zuko is constantly angry Iroh is calm because he has decided his own destiny with Zuko is anxious about the approval of others Iroh is at peace because he only seeks the approval of those who love him the difference between believing the lie and the specific truth manifests in the two characters from the very first episode unless you demonstrate emotional or physical differences between believing the truth and the lie it can come across like a meaningless moral platitude with no real bearing on the characters evolution but don't be fooled the truth can hurt knowing the truth does not need to make a character happier in Lois Lowry's The Giver Jonas is emotionally distraught when he learns the literal truth about his Society of the horrors of war torture and humanity's evil deeds it is quite common in dystopian fiction or realistic sci-fi or fantasy for the truth to be a darker area and a fiction that the protagonist believes here the emotional difference is one of maturity that begs the question is it better to know the truth or to be happy this automatically generates internal conflict when the mentor shows what this person could become like if they accept the truth but here's kind of the weird thing the protagonist does not technically need to accept the truth that the mentor believes for them to undergo a positive arc in the 2006 film history boys a class of boys are mentored by hick Dora who believes that education is valuable for education sake and while we see in the story that there is value in Hector's wisdom and the boys grow as people because of it the events of the story and another mentor also show the boys that the purpose of education is to get a job and set you up for university and life financially that it helps you integrate into society a mental character does not need to have the whole truth they could be wrong about or not know a lot of things but be right about one crucial thing that matters this is an idea rarely used but it's one with a lot of potential nobody in our lives parents teachers partners role models have the whole truth that we need to understand when we see through lies and grow as people the truth we come to is often a combination of insight from others and our own personal experience in a positive arc the mentors role is most narrative ly satisfying when their wisdom is specific to the lie the protagonist believes they may have the whole truth or your protagonist may find value in their insight but ultimately they may see through the lie and find a different truth that builds on the mentors wisdom Iroh and Hector though are examples of a mentor in a positive change arc where the protagonist changes for the better but what about negative change arcs or tragedies with the characters change for the worse in this the mentor guides the protagonist towards the truth but the protagonist ultimately rejects it leading to their downfall we can see this in obi-wan Kenobi in Revenge of the Sith where Anakin rejects the truth that love is stronger than physical power love won't save you Padme only my new powers can do that this dynamic is usually the most tragic because we can see what they were meant to become we see them into a fail and mean to us aren't mean to do that but one really interesting point of tension for the mentor in a negative arc is that the protagonists rejection of the truth is often rooted in the floors of the mentor this is in usually one of two ways the mentor does not empathize with their struggle enough alienating them or they force them to make a decision that they have not matured enough to make if they can't change then the protagonist is usually condemned to a negative arc unable to accept the truth a clear example of this is actually Toph whose brash and forceful mentoring in Avatar and lack of compassion for aang caused him to initially reject earthbending and its philosophy in most mentor relationships the mentor pushes back against the worst inclinations of a character and fosters the positive inclinations in hopes to bring them to the truth but this runs into a problem that Jon true be recognized in the anatomy of story you never want to create characters that sound like a mouthpiece for your ideas good writers express their moral vision slow and subtly primarily through story structure and the way the hero deals with a particular situation but how does the mean to a bring the protagonist to understand the truth without becoming a walking talking thematic mouthpiece how do they actually mentor the protagonist let's discuss three important scene types that you can use the first is the action reaction scene in the action half the character has a goal they meet an obstacle the outcome is usually disastrous and in the reaction half they react psychologically to the outcome they face a dilemma and they make a decision in Harry Potter and the Prisoner of Azkaban Harry wants to learn to conjure a Patronus fights a bar guard but he fails he then blames himself he has to decide whether to continue and he does this weaves into the truth that Lupin is trying to teach him he can never forget his happiest memories in the darkest of times because the ball you played soup don't read Harry Potter you have to use happy memories to conjure Patronus the mentor in the action reaction scene plays a very particular role they make sure that the protagonist gets past at least one of these sixth it's that they would be unable to alone and it is in working through the step that they see a little bit more pass to their lie which stipple your protagonists struggle with the most in a scene and how does this connect to their lie in Prisoner of Azkaban Lupin helps Harry work through the psychological reaction step in talking about how he can hear his parents crying voices before they died in Avatar Iroh helps Toph work through the dilemma step in talking through how accepting the help of others does not make you weak each of Harry and tofs isolation and failure shows us the consequences of them believing the lie rather than just telling us Harry that he doesn't hold on enough to happy memories and happy things and Toph that accepting the help of others makes her weak and this is interesting show us the positives and negatives to following the mentor and be more interesting than just if you use magic you'll end up injured and a generic non wot immobilizing way the steps they struggle with are most relevant to their lie the second type is the emotional opposition scene and it's a little bit more subtle this is a scene dynamic where the protagonist ends up in a different emotional state to where they started and the mentor helps them reach that point in the episode soccers master socket approaches master piandao to ask to train with him in the art of the sword he is feeling worthless and despondent let me guess you've come hundreds of miles from your little village where you're the best swordsman in town I have a lot to learn you're not doing a very good job of selling yourself your Butler told me that when I met you I would have to prove my worth but the truth is I don't know if I am worthy but by the end of the scene master piandao has Sokka feeling hopeful and of worth when he agrees to train him I will train you like with the first scene the mentor plays a very specific role in the emotional opposition scene they take an action that subverts the expectations of the protagonist this confronts them and causes emotional change the subversion and this is the important bit is because the action is usually motivated by the truth that they have that the protagonist does not this can leave them feeling positive like how master piandao unexpectedly give Sokka an opportunity to train because he understands that soccers humility and uniqueness is what makes him strong soccer's emotions of worthlessness are based in the lie and P and au sections are based in the truth but the emotional opposition scene can also leave the protagonist feeling worse in George RR Martin's The Clash of Kings Cersei mentor Sansa in the red cape during the Battle of the Blackwater when Stannis is assaulting King's Landing Sansa begins fearful but hopeful believing that the men out there are noble and brave men must be very brave though CID Sansa to ride out and face swords and axes but Cersei unexpectedly shocked Sansa and talking about how she hates her role as Queen breaking down this lie that all men and knights and Noble that Santa believes by telling her about the realities of a bloody war of death of rape and otherwise in the end Santa is left doubting this lie of nobility and she is no longer so hopeful in the battle the only way to keep your people loyal to you is to make certain that they fear you more than they do the enemy I will remember your grace as it's answer that she had always heard that love was a sure route to the people's loyalty Sansa's hopes and emotions are based in that lie of nobility and Circe's unexpected actions are based in the truth of brutality in a leaf Sansa doubtful by the end of the scene what unexpected action will your mentor take based on the truth that confronts the protagonists emotionally and exposes a little bit of the lie the third type of scene is action listen and it's the one that you've seen a bazillion times before this is where a character acts towards a certain goal and it goes horrific Lee and the protagonist says to learn where they went wrong to move forward and of course who gets to tell them that it's the mentor a horrific example of this can be found in Full Metal Alchemist Brotherhood we Edward an L attempt human transmutation in a vain effort to bring their mother back from the dead resulting in their bodies being splintered and mangled in a traumatic ghoulish form of their mother remaining Azumi Curtis takes them under her wing and she begins their realization of the truth that the human soul is invaluable and cannot be bought with magic the action listen scene is the most direct a mental is when it comes to espousing theme and relying too much on them can come across as he be handed crucially the emotional experience of their failure should change the protagonists to believe accept or understand a lesson that they could not before rather than it being a case of them just not having heard it in time like oh well if you told me that before I wouldn't have gone and done the stupid thing one interesting subversion of this is where the mentor gives the lesson before the protagonist is emotionally ready leading to them rejecting it and this actually inspires them to go do the reckless thing in George RR Martin's a game of Thrones Maester Aemon tells John that the men of the Nights Watch must have no divided loyalties to weaken their resolve this advice causes John to abandon his duties when he learns that nate is killed which whatever ended in his execution had he not been taken back by his friends only after making the mistake of leaving does he see the value in firming his loyalties to the watch which turned out to be a good mostly good idea spoils humanizing mentor characters so one problem that we often see is that mentors aren't really people they're just banks of infinite wisdom where you slots in a coin of personal failure and they happen to pump out the right fortune cookie because of this they don't seem to have flaws or the ones that they do have don't really play a role in raising tension in the narrative there are three common methods that I tend to find work best firstly using the action lesson scene to explore the mentor as a person in formal Alchemist Azumi had actually practice human transmutation herself long ago so she was drawn to it an owl and understands their struggle in Avatar IRA was once someone who saw power as the most important thing till it led to the death of his beloved son Lewton so it breaks his heart to see Zuko falling down the same path the action lesson seen is typically most compelling with a mentor themselves has already made the same mistake phrasing the action lesson seen as an exploration of the mentors mistakes showing the protagonist his or her scars literal and figurative helps the scene feel less like a moralistic sermon and more like a genuine emotional connection of empathy between the characters despite delivering the exact same information it allows you to avoid the fortune cookie machine trope 6z we talked before about having a mentor that only knows part of the truth relevant to the protagonist and this works really well because it allows us to see their flaws play out in the story humanizing them consider how the things they do not know might cause problems for them in the narrative either leading the protagonists into a situation that is not right for them or causing conflict between the two characters or even resulting in the mentors death thirdly and this is my favorite because it is so damn simple and almost no one does it giving them into a character arc one mildly common arc is the cynical mentor returns to default which can be seen in should I even please just just focus on this little bit the last Jedi Rey seeks out Luke the mentor but he rejects her as he has rejected the truth he once knew that the Jedi can bring balance to the force it has only raised persistent sense of hope and optimism that causes Luke to return to the fold and embrace his role as Jedi Master the second mentor arc is not inspired by the protagonist in Legend of Korra Tenzin is meant to be Corey's spiritual mentor but we soon find out that he has not yet connected with the spirit world as as expected of him eventually Tenzin has to grow to accept that he is not his father who could and that he has not failed because of that he is his own person which elements of your protagonist might confront them into where the truth that they forgot or don't know of which events in the story might confront them into emotionally and now we come to killing the mentor in 99% of cases that generic community or is killed because a the author wants the protagonist to grow up and be they need to make the decisions so think arrogance Brom Star Wars Yoda and Shakespeare's Falstaff now I want to be clear this is not a bad trope but this is only one purpose that the mentor death can serve and their narrative and it's what makes it feel so familiar for readers and there are other ways of making the protagonist grow up and make their own decisions in Avatar Iroh is simply separated from Zuko forcing him to make his own decisions and put arrows advice into practice only in embracing them are they reunited this can also be more effective and meaningful because the hero is now following their advice because it's worth following not out of a sense of nostalgia or owing it to them because they died for them but the easiest way to avoid the mentor sacrifice that some people is to give the mentors death a second purpose in the narrative in a game of Thrones Ned's death does not just propel the other characters Ford but it firmly establishes a central theme all men must die even perspective characters in Artemis Fowl the Opel deception the death of Julius root is less used to motivate Holly short but to firmly establish how big of a threat Opel poses the villain she took down Julius root when even Artemis couldn't thirdly remember how we discussed mentors having floors having their death result from a personal floor strictly distinguishes them from the sacrificial trope their people in errand houses the Dragon Prince King Harrow was killed because of his warmongering past and under estimating his enemy this also doesn't motivate Calum to act because he doesn't even know what happened instead has used it to create a point of dramatic irony with one character willingly keeping the secret of his death from them on top of this the fact that Gandalf was killed by a Balrog in 1956 does not make the death of your mentor less meaningful killing them into all will still be a strong emotional beat as long as we care about the relationship that those two characters had the label of being a mentor is not enough the reader has to see this relationship as a vital part of the protagonists emotional makeup to care how many times has they romantically been killed off effectively despite Romeo and Juliet as a side note killing the mentor is often used to force the hero to make their own decisions but this is a common result of having the protagonist be somewhat passive in the first act of the story with the mint or making the decisions about where they go what they do when they fight when they don't fight you can simply invert this and have the protagonists already making their own decisions that way it is natural for them to continue on their quest that doesn't really change finely designing the mentor I've always been a big proponent of the idea that the aesthetic of a character matters less than the function of them in the narrative when it comes to originality just because the mentor is an old safely white dude doesn't make him a cliche if he plays a sufficiently unique role Iroh was into cliche even though that cliches been around for literally hundreds of years but do consider alternate sources of wisdom for the character in dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas and yes we are going to talk about this the old cynical dude is mentored by the young and optimistic girl Cindy Lou yes one of the best mentor relationships out there this subversion is even purposeful and creative in Avatar The Last Airbender with a crew go in a deliberate search for a mighty masculine muscular earthbender only to find that his mentor is a blind short seemingly lean younger wisdom and strength come with experience and experience is limited to no demographic so to summarize the mentor has specific insight into the truth that the protagonist cannot yet see it can be effective to show the emotional differences between them because of this positive negative and neutral however the mentor does not need to have the whole truth they may be wrong about some things and the protagonists may find their own truth building on that specific insight secondly in a negative change arc the fall of the protagonist is usually facilitated by the flaws and mistakes of the mentor this is often by not empathizing with them enough or forcing them to make a decision they're not ready for causing them to reject the truth this is also often a major source of tension in the story thirdly in the action reaction scene the mentor teaches the protagonist by helping them get past one of the six steps that they could not by themselves this is often the psychological reaction step or the dilemma step this technique avoids moralizing to the reader because the mentor is never explicitly talking about the theme but the action helps the reader explore it fourthly in the emotional opposition scene the mentor helps them by taking action that subverts the expectations of the protagonist this decision is unexpected to them and causes emotional change because the mentor is motivated by a part of the truth that the protagonist does not yet understand while a protagonists emotions are based in the lie in the action lesson scene the mentor helps them by directly espousing a moral platitude following the failure of the protagonist this is most effective when it is a truth that they could not have accepted without the emotional experience of their failure once a version of this has turned them too soon causing them to reject the truth and actually do the reckless thing sixthly mentors are commonly humanized by having the mistakes that the protagonist makes in the action lesson scenes be ones that the mentor has made themselves before having the mentor only have part of the truth or giving them into a character ugh and simply killing them into as an understandable narrative move to force the protagonists to mature but give it a second purpose in the narrative it will still be an emotional beat in the story as long as the author shows that they are a vital part of the protagonists emotional makeup likewise consider some unexpected sources of wisdom in design your mental character and while I do want to say a big thank you to camp fire for sponsoring this video the reason I'm gonna take so long to talk about it is because I don't just want to do a sponsorship I want to do more of a review of the product this is a writing program designed to help you put together characters stories and worlds I was given this a few months ago beckoned timbre or November or something but I wanted to try it out extensively before recommending it or not because unlike with normal sponsorships this is to do with writing books so it matters to me a bit more and it might matters to you a bit more I want to start by saying that I do totally recommend campfire to certain types of writers let's get into why campfire has a character profiling feature a timeline feature a character arc feature a relationship map in a cyclopÃ¦dia tool and a world building tool the character profiling is pretty standard with what a lot of programs out there will have its customizable you can add file some backstory physical description personality traits whatever you want really useful but if you're just looking for that maybe it isn't for you I've personally used it to actually go through my chapters and highlight pieces of description and personality like that I actually use in the book to catalogue them so that I can keep my characterization consistent because I find that my characters often change eye color or something like that but campfire has two really unique things that I've found useful the first being a timeline feature where you can list the events detail what happens and draw connections between them for me I used it to mark out the first second and third acts of my book in a very visual way I had never done I could see where my midpoint fell where my darkest hour was where the emotional story beets fell and how well spaced they were you know how far is it between kind of the major emotional arcs of the story and I could see if they worked within the overall narrative structure I could see which parts in which scenes were superfluous I haven't done this but this would also be extremely useful for writers using multiple timelines either because they're writing from multiple perspectives or because of time travel and the second really amazing feature in camp fire is their character arc manager I genuinely cannot praise this enough because I never seen this anywhere else and it's such a vital part of our writing but I may be a bit biased because I actually suggested this I'm not on the design team or anything but when they first sent me the product they asked if I had any feedback after using it I was kind of taken aback because I suggested a character arc tool that allows you to map out how your character changes across the story I want to give big props to them for actually listening to feedback and building that into their program what really sold me on camp fire though and I don't think I'd recommend it without this feature is that you could interconnect all of these things you don't just list events in a timeline you attach those events to certain characters so that when you go on to their profile you can see the list of events that they're involved in similarly you can go through the events of your story and attach character arc points to those events for a particular character even more so you can pin events to parts of your map which you can upload you can literally map out the physical progression of your story with which scene takes place where you're integrating character development with plot with narrative with sitting with character why I like this is not just that it is virtually impossible to remember how all of these things intersect all the time but allowing you to not just record them but connect all of them helps clarify the way your story actually works and the way it doesn't work what I mean is that I could very easily see oh this scene doesn't have a carrot Tarak moment what did they learn in this scene and I can go back I went back and I saw they didn't really learn much I could cut the scene I could also see Oh their relationship changes in this scene and then it changes really quickly again I questioned if that was too soon if you put down everything you have into campfire you'll see which characters are useless which Saints have no emotional dimensions and what scenes interrupt the pacing of the story if you make it so that every single scene every event has to have a character Aqualad - it has to have a characters attached to it that sort of thing if you are a writer that really wants to focus on getting narrative structure and character arcs right the fundamentals of your story which should be everyone or you forget about the details of your characters like me then I totally recommend campfire however it's not a world building resource though at least not yet the encyclopedia allows you to create entries for anything but there are other programs out there that are more oriented towards pure world building and map building some people prefer to start with the world and that's okay but campfire isn't built for that and if you're just writing very casually short stories or poems it's more oriented towards long-form novels it's also constantly bringing out updates though and I can imagine it's only going to keep getting bitter I hope you at least check it out there's a link down below to them and I also recommend getting it on Steam that's just a slightly better product I feel but that is all for me I hope you enjoyed this discussion on mentor characters and this is a lot of work I've done over the last few weeks because this is been pretty intense lots of really late nights which my girlfriend has been hating me for but that's that's okay I've still got a civil wars won for world building which knowing my tendencies is gonna be two parts but I have a Blade Runner video essay coming out I hope I can get it done in a week let's see how that goes as always patreon so on thank you to everyone who's joined up you guys are absolutely incredible I just cannot possibly overstate that more because this is my career this is my life this is literally doing what I want to do which is education stuff waiting I love it it's a passion and you guys made that possible all hail Mischka even said that in awhile goodness and stay nerdy and i'll see you in the future\n",

copies will be available May 30th market down Supreme Leader mister commands you also follow me on instagram coz hashtag connect with the youths okay I've been talking for a while onto the video it's just so pretty civil wars have some awesome names like the Anarchy but good war rising which needs to be a book title and how cool is that it's no surprise that you want to write about them civil wars can range from small-scale skirmishes to the widespread systematic fracturing of a state into a dozen different factions and to discuss how they might fit into your story we're going to break it down into seven parts Civil War tension national identity the most important type of civil war tension three realistic factors and causes in civil war character motivation gaining and losing communicating instability in the few first acts violence and character motivation and the tragedy of the sitting a bit of a mouthful all of those topics but I really didn't know how to phrase them otherwise so part one civil war tension national identity now this might come as a surprise but World War one was kind of not very good in the decades afterward a whole lot of young men went home and started writing about how just very not good it was with famous books like All Quiet on the Western Front by Erich Maria Remarque emerging and if large-scale modern warfare sparked the war is miserable genre then Civil War started to the brother versus brother genre with stories like Walt Whitman's two brothers one North one south detailing how two brothers fought on opposite sides during the American Civil War and what their does to a brotherly relationship this is usually what characterizes the major differences between a war novel a civil war novel a writer can always position characters on opposing sides but the sitting of a civil war specifically gives a unique external focus in exploring how different groups of people believe how the same country and the same people should be for example John reads ten days that shook the world recounts the turmoil in the early 20th century Russia as more an ideological battle of national identity of the place of monarchy rights and political freedoms and Russia more than anything else this is the question and Captain America Civil War we need to be put in check whatever form that takes I'm game if we can't accept limitations we're bound realist for no better than the bad guys someone dies on your watch you don't give up we are for not taking responsibility for our actions this document just shifts the blame if we sign this we surrender our right to choose these are two fundamentally different interpretations of what it means to be an Avenger but also what it means to be an American is personal responsibility accepting limitation for past wrongs or is it ensuring that only you can be pointed to for blame now you might side with cap or you might be wrong the scope of the Civil War setup can more easily and explicitly ask what that national identity is what it means and where the flaws are and where the strengths are more easily than facing an external threat like thinness allows with the war acting as a thematic proxy pad to the most important type of Civil War tension the civil war story invites another specific kind of conflict where the perspective characters feel pulled to two or more sides of the conflict this is something that legend of korra season 2 actually did kind of well and yes before you yell at me and to my shock I am using season 2 as an example of interesting writing Cora is torn between her allegiance to the south and her family and her allegiance to the world unifying the two tribes and bringing spiritual harmony as the avatar this conflict plays out for half the season with Cora even threatening to take a judge's life as she struggles with to whom her allegiance belongs you take their lives and I'll take yours Cora calm down this is before the magic carpets arrived hmm I mean the conflict plays out and Cora has to resolve which side she falls on and where her loyalties lie that is a large part of the tension in the story and unlike that external broader more ideological and abstract conflict of national identity like an Captain America Civil War or John Reed's book this is a personal and internal conflict over your allegiance your relationships your interpersonal conflicts and your individual values in a normal war the protagonists don't usually get to pick a side or the side they do pick as a pretty easy choice we don't see Samwise Gamgee going here mr. fraud or Sauron might have a point there aren't usually the complicating factors of friends and family at least not to the degree that a civil war usually does there's no single legitimate state to decide what the official position is because the state is at war there are competing factions in legend of korra her uncle is the aggressor her father is the exiled criminal chief of the south and her friends are caught up attempting to stop third party war profiteering consider actually mapping out your characters and their relationships as well as how they changed throughout the story this will give you a grounded and clear source of conflict that feels a lot more personal than these abstract ideas will the reason that I say that this is the most important type of tension and civil war stories is that though the war setting might move the events of the plot the relationships in this web of characters you have will always be the primary medium of conflict in the story it's what gives emotional weight to what happens even if there is a philosophical backbone to the story the Raider will become invested through how characters feel betrayed confused or hatred towards those that sight against them all with them forcing them to work with people that they hate or forcing the DES fight against people that they love they might begin as friends acquaintances or rivals and in dub as something else as the reader comes to understand the characters deeply you can't spend the whole time abstractly preaching about how it's anti-american to be a communist part 3:3 realistic factors in causing civil war now while this isn't a world building video it is important to consider how the realistic causes of civil wars play into this web of characters that we've been talking about that creates this primary source of tension in your civil war story now I'm sure you expected this at some point but history is complicated and civil wars are no exception they have a myriad of causes and simplifying them to any one thing would be reductionist so I encourage you to read the paper that I've linked down below dynamics and logics of civil war which gives the question there are many more thousands of words that it deserves however we will discuss three important factors that they identify relevant to the narrative in particular grievance stability in violence firstly grievance in 2004 Collier and hofler summarized at ideological grievances are immaterial because they are constants in civil war according to this micro economic framework civil wars can be expected to break out we opportunity costs of fighting are low because of poverty and we're wartime gains stemming from looting natural resources lead to enrichment essentially they're saying that grievance motivations like political inequality or political and justices with a principled belief in getting rid of the billionaires with a democratic guillotine to the Nick these important causes then a socio-political environment that is a low risk and be high returns for starting a civil war that you'll get a lot out of it and you haven't got much to lose if that's the case an ideology will spring up and give it some framing give it some momentum we do actually see this in the nineteen eighteen to nineteen twenty two Russian Civil War while there were ideologies at play capitalism monarchism and of course God knew usually there was a lot to be gained economically and politically for the monarchist in capitalist classes and not a lot to lose for the working class because if they did nothing then they would lose their newfound influence anyway but to note though grievance does play a role to pretend that Lenin's passionate belief in working class rights played no role would be foolish Asst but grievances can be remedied in a stable state with institutions to address them leading on to our next point secondly instability statistically civil wars break out more often in states that are already unstable following on from that low risk high returns model the first Roman Civil War is a clear example of this with the dispossessed poor flooding into Rome leading to conflicts between the popularise like Gaius Marius and the optimal is like sulla tensions that resulted in the obliteration of the Roman Constitution and members holding consul beyond legal limits as we can see instability is often due to the breakdown in the established systems that deal with conflict and grievances in justices and inequalities to build on this a 2005 paper highlights that a state's instability is hallmarked by an inability of opposing factions to believe that the other faction can act in good faith at all the problem when it comes to the institutional choices is that there is no such impartial third party that can be trusted to enforce contracts this is the origin of the commitment problem in politics in 1981 the Chilean civil war sparked after a breakdown in official institutions and the Congress and the president being wholly unable to act in good faith towards one another they looked for any time any opportunity to undermine one another and of course the civil war thirdly violence a realistic start of the war is I can play lists important then realistic reasons that people would join a particular site this is what your characters would do this is the action in the plot it's ultimately not just how the Civil War plays out or how would start on the broader sense but in that narrow sense in the scenes in the story of your characters what makes them pick a site though anyone's reasons can range from strictly ideological to strictly for personal gain one factor that is commonly missed is proximity to violence civilians reiated to indiscriminate violence in their region by colluding with the perpetrators adversary this was in the case of the 1936 to 1939 Spanish Civil War with civilians joining the Republicans the Afghan Civil War arguably inflating terrorist groups in the 1955 to 1975 Wow that went on for two decades Vietnam Civil War with civilians joining the Vietcong when bombed nearby by the United States ask yourself where the violence breaks out in your Civil War who does it affect and how does this play into your characters decisions part for character motivation gaining and losing there are a lot of other factors but these three in particular are interesting when telling the story of your web of characters that gives rise to the important internal Civil War tension that we talked about just before in considering what your characters have to gain by joining a particular side think not just about material gain like money or land or status but their values in George RR Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire Walder Frey doesn't so much join the Starks initially to gain land and money he's already pretty filthy rich but to marry off one of his daughters to the king in the north and bring house Frey the prestige and influence that he craves and this question also isn't just about what they that character would gain would a father fight for one side to ensure that his family is provided for in the case of his death even if he might disagree with them maybe your characters sister is adamant about joining one side and they do so too because they don't want to fight her even though they may not agree ideologically maybe something that someone else gains is more important to them than what they could gain however in the case of the common man what one might lose is often closely related to simply Jo in Tulsa vaisyas cold mountain the character and men is fighting for the Confederates without choice the English Civil War wasn't separated into roughly north and south by chance the average person fighting in those armies could lose their life and livelihood if they refused to fight for the government of that region consider where your characters are geographically and whether this will help determine which sides of the war they will fall on one really interesting thing to do with this gaining or losing question is building a character arc some authors use what a character has to lose in a civil war as a means of showing character development initially Sir Jorah is an agent sent by King Robert to spy on Daenerys Targaryen informing him of her movements and her successes he does this in hopes of earning a royal pardon and returning from exile to Westeros but as the story progresses he joins Denney wholeheartedly giving up his one chance at being legitimized again and returning home a free man this is a major point of development for him as a character par-5 communicating instability in the first act this is most important in a story depicting events leading up to a civil war like in max Brooks World War Z which tells the story of a zombie plague outbreak and how this leads to civil wars in Israel China bunch of other countries and almost the United States all we see is the intense instability that leads up to it there is a period called the great panic after a vaccine is found to be fake the stock market plummets and people die of hypothermia as they flee into the wilderness but when writing one really effective way to communicate these big notions like instability in a state which is kind of hard to see from our limited perspective is to use the everyday experiences of a perspective character particularly in the first act is bridge suddenly too expensive to buy do they suffer a panic attack when they learn that help isn't coming and what did the children do when teachers don't turn up to school because they haven't been paid by the government using a couple of scenes to explore this grounded and personal fate of the instability on your characters will establish a feeling of uncertainty and instability before civil war more than seeing politicians argue on television ever will this is also a cornerstone in the tone and atmosphere that you build in your story in the first act the more basic the struggles in everyday life your characters face the more desperate the tone of your writing following on from this the type of instability that the characters experience does matter in legend of korra we see cora unable to deal with spiritual instability in the water tribe prior to the war it causes chaos and this motivates her initially to join unalaq and hopes of bringing harmony to the spirits of the Water Tribe because that is what he stands for whether it's financial problems religious persecution fear of law enforcement or otherwise the type of instability that we see in the first act of the novel will help determine what your characters a have to gain and B have to lose in deciding their goals and allegiance during the Civil War pad sex violence and character motivation in considering violence which events might inspire them to join aside for purely emotional reasons even if they may not agree 100% ideologically with that faction we don't necessarily vote for a party that we agree with on every single policy and there's no reason that that should change during a civil war it's practically just Parliament just with a few extra guns and a bit more yelling often the feeling of I and my family are being targeted is a lot stronger a motivation then I kind of agree with this guy it's a lot easier to fight for your home than it is to fight for an abstract idea and civil wars are fought in your home the question is who your characters may feel the perpetrator are and that may differ depending on each of your characters experiences once again in A Song of Ice and Fire house Karstark first felt that they were fighting to protect the north but after King Robb execute Lord Karstark for treason while they didn't turn on the northern cause they certainly turned their back on the Starks and the rest of the house abandoned them entirely however a carrot rock that is sometimes used is that a character goes from siding with one faction for emotional reasons say family guilt or misplaced trust and then they finally find their true philosophical allegiance though the story is not a civil war Zuko did precisely this going from his allegiance to his family for emotional reasons to joining team avatar for philosophical ones once I deliver the Avatar to my father he will welcome me home with honor we've created an air of fear in the world and if we don't want the world to destroy itself we need to replace it with an era of peace in a kindness do not focus purely on the ideological reasons that come out of the why the war was fought for joining a cause but the relational Geographic and emotional reasons that come out of the how the war is fought parts even the tragedy of the setting there's always been this myth about war that becoming a soldier means going to foreign lands seeing new places finding glory and returning home a new man however true this is it's not civil wars have never quite attracted the same glamour the same tale of adventure they take place in your homeland the bombs go off in your city the blade falls on your people if not your brother or sister then the brother or sister of someone you know in transfer Xia's cold mountain the American Civil War is shown to be uniquely destructive in the sense that both sides know that in the end whoever wins the country still lost thousands of lives and would have a shattered national identity the Union soldiers aren't taking foreign crops like the Germans took French farms they're taking the livelihoods of their fellow-countryman a lot of emotional weight can be derived from this from showing the effects on places that your characters are personally connected with because the story will be set in their home this isn't exclusive to civil war novels Wars can take place in their home in a normal war novel perhaps they find their favorite romantic spot desecrated with bodies perhaps they're forced to attack a town that they once lived in there isn't a foreign land that puts a distance between them and the destruction and that immediacy can really hurt and I might leave it there because I'm getting pretty close to delving into not just civil war but talking war generally which is a video in and of itself so in summary firstly I have a book coming out May 30th on writing and world building and it adds a super pretty cover pre-order down below secondly civil war stories are often better suited to explore national identity than other war stories because the conflict is internal from the perspective of the country itself fought within the country itself by its people thirdly the most important type of tension in a civil war story tends to be interpersonal conflict rising out of one's allegiance to a friend family or country and picking aside fourthly if you want to base your civil war in strict realism lofty ideological motivations tend to be secondary factors and starting a civil war to low risk high return socio-economic political environments on top of us a state is usually intensely unstable in the years beforehand people tend to join a site based on who they feel are the perpetrators of violence against them fifthly consider what characters have to gain and lose in their role in the civil war both materially and characteristically historically this has often been determined by mere geography some authors use a character's willing choice to lose something for a cause often status wealth or friends as a hallmark of character development sixthly established the instability leading up to the Civil War through the everyday experiences of your ordinary characters building on this the type of instability the reader sees financial religious political or other will often effectively establish beforehand what a character stands to lose or gain in their role in the Civil War as well as tone seventhly how violence is perpetrated is often more important than the Y or the who does it in determining whether someone will join a cause it may be more interesting to have a character decide for emotional reasons something that we actually don't see all that commonly more than for philosophical ones viii Lee a hallmark of the Civil War Chandra is the emotional weight of the war itself taking place on home soil instead of foreign soil whichever side wins both sides lose consider how the destructive events of your story might play out into the past memories or attachments of your characters but that is all from me thank you to all of my amazing patrons especially those of you who joined up over the last while if you want to support the channel obviously patreon steyr thank you so much patreon that you they all get kind of background stuff on on on the on writing book as well as background stuff on all the videos that they make I'm always on there on the discord talking with them obviously come follow me on all my social media and so on I'm trying to get an Instagram started to hashtag connect with the youths I'm sorry if this video felt a little bit rushed I've been a bit pressed for time this week I've had a lot of commitments on and just managing the the book thing kind of bringing that all out and dealing with all the questions and making sure I'm doing it all right on the timeline schedule it can just be a bit stressful but for the moment I'm probably gonna do a few nerdy videos because I've done a lot of long-form hella hard videos over the last while I did that deliberately for a particular reason but I'm gonna probably do one on azula's psychology next Oh within the next couple videos anyways stay nerdy comes for mr. Petri on all he'll Mishka and I'll see you in the future\n",

      "so your main character as a wizard let's call him Graham Graham the wizard who likes cats and throughout a story he's going to grow in magical power he starts off pulling bunnies out of hats not a hugely useful combat ability and he's gonna end up shooting lightning bolts from his fingertips instead of bunnies his abilities are going to escalate and it's the writers job to make that escalation believable and avoid some of the many pitfalls so let's take grain the wizard who likes cats on a journey and discuss character alkaline power escalation escalation and tension power creep power ceilings and comparables and character challenges and today's video is brought to you by my magical patrons if you want to see more of this kind of writing and world building content then please do consider supporting me down at the link below plus one new patron who signs up this month will win a copy of on writing and we're building signed which compiles a whole bunch of this kind of stuff into a easy to reference easy to read book thank you I'll see you on the patron discord the first common way that writers handle parry escalation is by integrating it with character arcs this trope goes way back to stories like only their true noble and honest King Arthur is able to pull the sword out of the stone it is everywhere that gaining abilities or mastering certain technologies requires specific character traits such as in Brandon Sanderson's storm line archives where the characters of Dylan are and Caledon slowly attain new abilities like those of the mystical order called the Knights radiant but they can only do so in accepting and living up to certain moral ideals Caledon gains new abilities when he accepts they're protecting others means he should even protect those that he hates this technique usually means that Paris collation aligns with the growth of your characters and this can be a really great way to not only ensure that character development is always front and center in your story but that abilities feel earned part of Paris collation is giving weight and meaning to gaining new abilities and here overcoming obstacles means overcoming personal issues the flow of the tension in the story becomes more cohesive because the internal and external conflicts are fundamentally connected and some writers don't just do this to give external conflicts emotional weight but also to manifest internal conflicts in a really visceral whay legend of korra actually has some amazing imagery in this and her dealing with PTSD and part of the strategy is structural stories that use character arc aligned paris collation will usually mean that failure to defeat the antagonist or master certain abilities is caused by or happens at the same time as failures in one's character evolution for example Zuko finds himself unable to generate lightning in Avatar The Last Airbender and Iroh attributes' this to him being unable to resolve the emotional turmoil inside of him choosing between good and evil but it is not as simple as giving a powerup to your characters whenever they become a better person like the universe hands out Good Samaritan coupons although maybe to be fair maybe your universe does that who am I to say this is because allowing characters to fail in using powers at crucial points in the narrative is important because just like morale struggles and failures throughout the story I want make their eventual growth at the end all the more empowering failure to use parts of the power system are what make their eventual mastery so satisfying this is especially true if failure has major consequences for their emotional journey though character arc aligned Paris collation is sometimes inverted where Paris collation is actually a failure of character consider mellitus in seven deadly sins who holds the ability to counter any attack thrown at him it has virtually unlimited power at his fingertips should he give in to hatred and rage these sorts of stories often featuring overpowered characters or characters with somewhat uncontrollable magic allow the author to explore a unique tension between gaining the ability to defeat the antagonist and remaining a good person or even human it's a thematic idea that power costs your humanity and their character occurs often focused around overcoming the temptation of power and finding a new way to defeat the antagonist another example of this is where becoming a better person actually deep how is the character like Zuko loses the ability to firebend when he lets go of his rage and hatred which previously fuelled it and they have to find a new way to gain power where normal Paris collation where the character grows and power as they grow as a person doesn't usually affects their relationships too much the power escalation and these kinds of stories is give a narrative weight by seeing how it affects the relationships of the protagonist and how they view themselves because it's usually in a negative way becoming a great source of internal and relational tension and I feel like there's a lot to kind of mind there that we haven't seen in fantasy stories yet and while character arc aligned Paris collation has its benefits it will not fit for every story extremely hard power systems tend to stay away from aligning with character arcs because emotions and character traits aren't strictly definable or predictable really quantifiable if handled badly the escalation and power can amount to these tropa scenarios where Graham the wizard who like scared succeeds because let's take the power of friendship or just getting really angry and yelling louder than his opponent here's looking at you Dragon Ball Z overall it's a more useful technique for soft power systems if you wish to have a power system where the only factor is how creative and intelligent a character is and using it then incorporating character elements is going to undermine the dramatic tension that you're going for and that's totally fine it's not gonna fit for your story that's not a problem you can still have really powerful character arcs and there's a lot to be said for emotional beats of a story that stand on their own that don't need that sort of propping up and where authors don't want to do this it mostly comes down to two principles predictability and consistency two principles that make powers logical and believable as they grow in the story however they gain them I will refer you to my series on hard magic systems because I kind of talk through this for the entirety of the video and this is specifically about power escalation but basically make sure that evolutions in your power system are predictable and consistent that's what makes them feel earned in a hard magic system but let's talk about to escalation and tension it's almost universally true for the power system to escalate as the tension escalates this allows Graham the wizard who likes cats to face a bigger stakes do grander things and defeat more dangerous threats as the story progresses something that's completely natural in both a single book or a series of books consider leave Crossman's magician series the first book has Quinton and other characters using moderate magical abilities to take down the beast a creature killing students the second book scales up these stakes and their powers as they face old gods whoever turned to get rid of magic and the third does this yet again scaling up these stakes and their powers with the entirety of the magical world about to be destroyed and the characters having to learn bigger and more fantastical spells to resolve the plot like literally recreating the magical world it's really fascinating to see what the magic system is capable of and whether throughout a single book or a series scaling up these stakes the threat and escalating the power system with it is exciting to a point some writers fall into the trap of thinking there because either each story in a series or the arc of their single book is continually bigger better bolder stronger faster hashtag more with continually grander displays of the power system that will be more exciting and emotionally investing but no of course not this is called power creep and it's when power escalation eclipses story and undermines narrative tension one reason for this is stakes one symptom of power creep is exponentially growing stakes to match the Poway escalation book one gram the wizard eyes katz is concerned because we have to save this family book to graham the wizard relies Katz is concerned because this entire city will be destroyed book three Graham the wizard relies Katz is concerned because this entire planet will be destroyed at some point readers just stop caring because we have no real grasp of that kind of scale in Animus foul the Last Guardian the possible loss of Butler a character that we have known for eight books now in the climax has more emotional weight than the possibility of the world ending and this is especially true if this kind of scale is used over and over again in a series which continual power escalation tends to lead to because the writer thinks that they could easily solve small problems now a second reason is immersion there is a lot of Paris collation in Sanderson's Mistborn series but it never loses the foundational rules and framework that made it unique and immersive in the final Empire the first book skilled people doing very smart things with the element ik magic system in contrast Shonen anime like Naruto are often criticized for losing what made their original stories unique and immersive with characters shooting energy blasts into the moon and the strategy and ninja training that used to be at the core of the show hardly even measuring anymore and with Sanderson's narrative remained immersive because the escalation of elemental powers always felt possible within the world from the beginning Steve Perry escalation risks losing immersion and a degree of what made the original story special especially if some of the nuances of the magic system for the sake of grandeur abilities and this is why power ceilings are important establishing the magnitude to what your power system can go early in the story in which house keys The Matrix the power ceiling was established to using the antagonists the agents with one very specific and clear ability this was the peak of one's abilities within the matrix and it's what we knew neo could be hitting towards power ceilings not only helped how us feel earned though because the escalation didn't come out of nowhere but it helps the story remain immersive because you don't undermine the rules you created as the power system escalates of course necessarily don't break this power ceiling which is exactly what the Matrix sequels did as well as season two of Legend of Korra Korra had already mastered all four elements and the Avatar state by the end of season one out of four this was the power ceiling and then [Music] fighting the embodiment of chaos with the laser beams this was a bizarre fight that was difficult to care about and this led to the FMH and criticisms losing some of what made the original story special for the sake of spectacle because they think they have to do this to raise tension though I am happy to say that the writers of Korra recognized this for the most part in contrast Remini faced rift war saga worked because despite massive power escalation with fireballs in the first book and fighting ancient dragon gods in the third book it established a power ceiling with matt cross the black and Feist stuck to it so it wasn't surprising that by the third book we were at that level that we are briefly seen before and it's here we get to the heart of the issue how do you maintain or continue building tension when the author does not wish the power system to escalate any more say the author wants characters to become as powerful as they will ever be partway through the book maybe Graham the wizard who likes cats reaches his peak by the end of the second act just like kid in Ursula wins a wizard of Earthsea what then the assumption is that because the greatest tension is at this point in the story then their powers must escalade continually till that point otherwise they would be powerful enough to resolve the plot right well no or a second scenario would be an ongoing series the assumption is that because Graham the wizard who likes cats needs to become more powerful than villain one to defeat them in the first book thus to maintain tension villain two must be more powerful than villain one and then Graham must become more powerful than villain two ad infinitum otherwise grin the wizard who likes cats could resolve the plot instantly right well once again no we'll talk through two primary techniques which address this and are arguably most effective when they're used together in comparables and character challenges firstly in comparables in comparables our abilities that don't work on the same scale as the protagonists in Marvel's Jessica Jones series the protagonist has super strength and each of the three seasons are self contains stories with new antagonists in each arc in the first series joins us to face down against a man who can force others to do anything with just his voice second season she faces down against a family member with these same powers as her and in the third season the antagonist isn't even powered he's just an extraordinarily cunning serial killer of these three powers only one exists on the same scale as the protagonist and they weren't even technically an antagonist the tension dynamic and obstacles to taking down someone who can mine control are vastly different to taking down a manipulative cunning serial killer with the law on his side despite no escalation in Jones's powers with her being essentially as strong as she ever will be right from the start tension is steadily maintained because villain 3 isn't stronger than villain 2 or villain 1 they just pose a different challenge for Jessica Jones the obstacles our hero faces are incomparable and even if she does get stronger as the story goes beating kilgrave in season 1 does not make her automatically equipped to defeat Sellinger in season 3 in comparables mean that the threatened antagonist poses does not have to be measured against the previous antagonist and a protagonists power is escalating even to the highest point does not mean they're automatically stronger than the person with that incomparable ability Patrick Rothfuss is the author of name of the wind that Kingkiller Chronicle which involves Kavitha continually becoming more powerful within the magic system across the books in talking about handling power creep he said --kavitha learns things and become slightly more powerful but he solves all of his problems not through the application of power but because he's clever and if you're clever once you have to be clever again there's constant tension and it's this idea that is really at the heart of stories that use and comparables attaining power alone won't defeat the antagonist because the powers of your protagonists and your antagonists are not on the same scale they've got to have something else like maybe the hash tag power friendship secondly character challenges in a similar way to how incomparable abilities mean that power escalation doesn't really matter creating antagonists who challenge the protagonist in a personal way does the same thing the Joker of Nolan's The Dark Knight is arguably the weakest antagonist ed Batman faces and the stakes are even the smallest in this story it's just two boatloads of people compared to a whole city but it's arguably the most tense of the trilogy power escalation matters little here because the tension of the story is derived from moral choices that Batman is repeatedly forced to make no matter how powerful he becomes not that Batman has powers like gray in The Wizard of Oz cats as mentioned before though these two strategies are best used together an antagonist whose abilities require them to not just be powerful but smart and they challenge them in a personal way one example is Daredevils adversary kingpin he exemplifies this a blind athlete against a cunning criminal with super-strength where much of the tension is really derived from not matching him but where the kingpin can force him to kill a moral lion that he has refused to cross these techniques also work for overpowered characters or stories about people whose powers don't escalate at all handling Paris collation is difficult and it's been done badly a bazillion times it's also been done really well a bazillion times it's really more about allowing the story to grow organically without it losing the spectacle that ultimately the magic system while a really cool part of any of the world building and how it is used in the story is there to support the rest of the story to support the characters their growth their relationships and the tension they have with the antagonist spectacle of the magic system by itself isn't necessarily that engaging as much as we love the magic systems that we create so to summarize all of these points one way to escalate power systems logically believably and make powers feel earned is with character arc aligned power systems this helps with a narrative creation by tying internal and external conflicts together whoever it is less suited for hard magic systems - it is natural for power systems to escalate as the tension Rises throughout a single book or a series however taking this too far results in power creep which in turn undermines narrative tension through our lack of believable stakes and a loss of immersive elements 3 power ceilings not only help house feel earned because the reader sees capabilities beforehand but it helps maintain immersion because power escalation doesn't under the world that you originally created for one way to maintain tension without Paris collation is through incomparable abilities meaning that Paris collation is not necessarily required to defeat them and each antagonist to need not be measured against the last and five a second way to maintain tension without paris collation is through character challenges and taking us who challenge the protagonist on a personal level and the tension is derived from difficult more choices that they're forced to make these two strategies are best used together though and that's me this video has been held people on the discord you would know normally I'm done by like around Wednesday with the script took me to Friday morning it's like Friday afternoon as I'm filming filming it now so I'm gonna have to really muscle to get all the editing done the topic changed bazillion times I really enjoyed doing these kind of technical videos ones which kind of look at writing techniques more than tropes tropes are fun to talk about but techniques are ultimately going to be more helpful like the two videos I did on delivering exposition which if you haven't seen go check them out are some of the best videos I feel have you ever done in this series and III really liked them because they feel a lot more grounded and helpful and like broadly applicable to every writer but yeah so what what tell me about tell me about your stories what's the power escalation like what's the magic system and how does it grow where does it start where does it end how big can it get let me know down below in the meantime stay nerdy and I will see you in the future you\n",

      "greetings fellow nerds it is i some call me tim so you can have fantastic descriptive pieces incredible dialogue amazing prose but unless you understand things like tension structure and pacing you're going to have a stilted novel and that's why today we're going to focus on that last one pacing it's super important and yes i'm going to be wearing a different shirt throughout the video don't think about it too much i filmed this the day after after i realized that don't have a really exciting beginning to the video and what better way to do that than with two swords because swords always make things more exciting okay maybe not onto the video pacing is the speed of experience of events for the reader in your story but fast pacing is not necessarily good pacing slow pacing is important good pacing is about knowing which parts of your story need to feel fast and which parts of your story need to feel slow and there are kind of two levels of pacing in a story there's the minutia of pacing a particular scene or chapter and there's the pacing of the overall narrative and a lot of pacing videos and articles and books focus on that first level of minutiae techniques and while it is important and we will discuss it we will also narrow in on that second half that i think is less understood but arguably more important so the minutia sentence structure literary devices and grammar can all be used on a paragraph to paragraph basis to accelerate or slow the pacing consider the section from robert ludlum's the born identity he was crunched by the wall jason stood up and fired at the sound of his gun the beam swung over to him he was the target two shots came from the darkness a bullet ricocheting off a metal strip in the window steel punctured his neck blood erupted racing footsteps the executioner was running towards the source of the light short punchy sentences move through events quickly giving the feeling of speed sentences are action reaction the instant switch between decision and consequence compressed time there is no time to ponder the sharp clear language isn't poetic it's gritty to create this very real fear this chapter also finishes on a cliffhanger all of these techniques together give the feeling of fast pacing to the scene so the reader feels they are moving through events quickly making them want to turn the page because any sentence could be the character's last these techniques are most easily exemplified in action scenes but they can be applied to any scene of tension in contrast consider the scene from patreon this is the rest of us just live here back when i first went to hospital on the night of the accident steve gave me this oil to put on my scar to keep it from stretching and getting bigger i often get caught in a loop with it rubbing it in wiping it off rubbing it in wiping it off and until i'm sure that i'm doing far more stretching damage to the scar than ever would have happened by just using my face these sentences are longer more complex lingering on actions and full of introspection like we're traveling at the same speed of the character is thinking there's repetition and poeticism taking page time to articulate the feeling beyond the action with greater space between action and reaction whether a fast or slow paced technique they're aimed at broadly mimicking the experience of the characters at hand fast pace gives the reader the feeling that there's no time to stop and think that we have to keep moving while a slow pace gives emotional beats more weight by allowing the reader to simmer in them simmering those emotions it's because of this that pacing is intricately tied to tension fast pacing tends to work better for scenes of high tension like fight scenes because the reader is dragged by the scruff action to reaction action to reaction unable to ponder because any action could be fatal in contrast authors like john green use a lot of slow pacing in moments of introspection to let the reader feel the emotional turmoil and emphasize the difficulty of character growth forcing the reader through such things too quickly would make the decision or trauma feel inconsequential or easily resolved that it happened and then they just moved on how you spend your page time says this is important or this is interesting but this understanding of pacing techniques does lead to a misconception that moments of high tension require those techniques typically aimed at a fast pace which is simply not true you can use those slower paced techniques james bell in elements of fiction writing calls this stretching the tension lee child squeezes an amazing amount of tension out of a few seconds because he's not at all afraid to make us wait and that's the key to tension it is waiting the longer the better this passage here in lee child's worth dying for features jack reacher calculating and throwing a single punch and while he does use a number of techniques to accelerate the pace like sharp non-poetic language child also allows for detailing reaches thought processes and longer sentences indicative of a slower pace in summary this relationship between tension and pacing well they're more guidelines than actual rules and bell sentiment to stretch the tension is true to an extent it's why waiting to reveal who the serial killer is and a thriller is so satisfying the weight gives it payoff but using the stretching technique too often can weaken its effect you shouldn't use it in every fight scene every moment of tension because if you did it would result in often a slow plodding pace scene of what is meant to be high tension when it should feel fast hence why doing what bell describes at a few very important moments of high tension in the story works consider maybe once per act stretching these few seconds or a very short moment of tension in the world into a long passage of text but at the same time bell's advice is holy sound for stretching emotional tension in stephen shop's geese the perks of being a wallflower we spend a lot of page time inside charlie's head delving into the mind of a mentally unwell teen struggling with his friend group breaking apart the author doesn't just say charlie had a breakdown and move on he stretches the emotional tension for pages by showing us charlie repeatedly saying that he is totally fine before we read his thoughts spiraling more and more until suddenly we end up at i'm so sorry that i wasted your time because you really do mean a lot to me and i hope you have a very nice life because i really think you deserve it i really do i hope you do too okay then goodbye chapter close emotional beats can't be action reaction because you lose the emotion at that speed but this is pacing on a scene by scene level when it's also important to consider the pacing of the core narrative those techniques deal with the visceral feeling of a scene but you can have fast and slow paced scenes and still not have a well-paced story you've probably heard the advice keep the story moving stephen king probably and that's what pacing is about and one way that your narrative comes to a grinding halt is with what we'll call the sidequest problem if you've ever played a video game you'll be familiar with the kind of stories the quests where your hero has a goal to do zed maybe let's say slay a dragon but to do that he needs the sword of reckoning goal y but to get that he has to find the temple of sky gold x but to do that he needs to convince a witch to tell him where it is gold w this kind of storytelling manufactures obstacles between the player and the end goal that feel pretty arbitrary aimed at lengthening the game without too much complexity and even if you're doing things you don't feel like you're necessarily moving the story forward because these obstacles are largely arbitrary they don't really mean anything especially if the player isn't uncovering a mystery in the meantime or the challenges don't force the player character to evolve as a person the result is bad pacing it feels unnecessarily slow and dragging regardless of how tough it is to get the sword of reckoning or kill the guardian to the temple of sky because you don't really feel like the narrative is moving forward director and writer ryan coo highlighted one of reasons for pixar's storytelling success simplify focus combine characters and hop over detours these manufactured obstacles side quests are practically detours from the core narrative you could take out this obstacle and you wouldn't lose anything of value because there isn't really a narrative reason for these obstacles to exist this is the side quest problem and it happens in books as well when considering the pace of your core narrative figure out which obstacles make your ending more meaningful and which ones could be removed does the obstacle a fundamentally alter the ending b fundamentally develop your main character's character arc or c reveal something new and a mystery to the reader if not then consider cutting it because it's probably just a side quest that halts the pacing of your core narrative or if it's a grey area consider combining that obstacle with one which certainly isn't a side quest restricting your obstacles in this way means that the narrative is continually moving forward it's got pace whether written to be fast or slow side quests don't really give any pace to the core narrative because it's functionally brought to a standstill flashbacks often feel out of place for similar reasons they don't make the ending more meaningful they don't necessarily reveal anything and they don't necessarily help develop the main character meaning that there's the stilted halt in the pace all of a sudden no matter how it's written the 2013 game beyond two souls by david cage is a narrative-driven game about jodie who has psychic powers finding herself and avoiding those who would abuse her abilities chapter 14 is called navajo detailing her ventures to join a small native american family living in the isolated midwest because every main character needs a spiritual side quest featuring indigenous populations it is an incredibly long and slowly paced chapter to the point of being one of the most unenjoyable parts of the game by its end now the main character jody does evolve significantly by the end of it but we don't uncover any new information in the mystery nor do its events alter the ending for how much game time that the story and the player have to spend there there is very little payoff in terms of moving the core narrative forward at its heart it was badly paced for its place in the narrative you've got to think about how much page time you're spending and how much payoff you're getting in terms of moving the core narrative forward what i'm getting at here is that good pacing for your core narrative is about whether the reader feels they're getting closer to the big thing in a mystery like thomas harris's red dragon it's whether they feel they're getting closer to figuring out who's been murdering all the people in jasmine warger's young adult my heart and other black holes it's whether as well as getting closer to resolving her mental health suicidality issues so when editors tell us that we need a fast-paced beginning because we all have the attention spans of four-year-olds these days they're not talking about opening with a fight scene or an intense argument or even using those fast-paced techniques that we discussed they're talking about how quickly the author puts the reader on the track towards the big thing this is done with the hook a question the first twist the first reveal in the inciting incident and then after that how quickly does the reader feel that they take the next step towards the big thing slower pacing of a narrative usually throughout the second act slows down page time between these steps towards the big thing because they're already immersed in the story but within all of this we have to talk about side quests versus subplots when it comes to pacing a subplot by interacting with the main storyline adds complications at least it should by way of emotion or physical means with the subplot charging right into the main plot and wrecking all sorts of havoc a very simple and well-known example of a subplot is in shakespeare's romeo and juliet the main plot is the romance between 18 year old romeo and 13 year old 13. romeo the rivalry between the capulets and montagues is a subplot because it invades the main plot by complicating their relationship it plays an intricate role in their character arcs and fundamentally alters the ending by culminating in their deaths though not before a very long monologue because who can die in a shakespearean play without a six minute monologue first if it was a side quest though then romeo and juliet would just have to defuse tensions between their families halfway through the story in order to meet up one time only for the rivalry to never resurface never alter their character arcs and not change the ending with this understanding i want to talk about something that editor september c fawkes brought up that i hadn't considered can undermine pacing subtext i was once editing a manuscript that had all the right beats and emotional draws but it felt slow and boring i discovered was because it had next to no subtext and i wasn't intellectually invested in understanding and figuring out the text subtext enriches a story because whether subconsciously or consciously the reader is continually investigating the text for extra meaning it's an understanding the text hints at or gives implicitly it's reading between the lines without it the pace can slow down because there is less information being delivered in the same words and there is less intrigue for the reader to uncover and follow consider the following passage from ned vizzini's it's a funny kind of story you alright man this should be my name i could be like a superhero you alright man uh i stumble don't bug craig ronnie is like he's in the craig zone he's craiging out yeah i move the muscles that make me smile see how words work they betray your mouth and walk away are you okay he asks i'm fine i tell her the abstraction of craig's feelings from his action to smile tell us about his true emotions and something of his depression the fact that ness chooses to paste this passage as slowly with him saying he's fine and having difficulty getting words out tells us something about his character on the surface the events of the story say that craig is fine like he says but the way it's written tells us there is something seriously wrong and that he isn't okay if used intelligently subtext can help the writer feel like every scene is getting them closer to the big thing even if what's happening on the surface may not feel like it's directly contributing to the ending it's like they're following breadcrumbs through the scenes that they can only sometimes find but we gotta turn to world building we gotta talk about how fantasy and sci-fi have a particular hurdle to overcome a challenge to meet a bird to hit with stone don't ever hit birds with stones and that is pacing with world building whether it's details about the magic system the politics the religion or otherwise unless woven expertly into your story world building can seriously hamper the pacing of a scene or your core narrative forcing the reader to stop and learn about the roses anjaro's book's sufficiently advanced magic features a complex magic system and though enjoyable it can be criticized for the stop start pacing of its fight scenes they lose a lot of tension because roe has to continually segue away from an emotional or action beat to remind the reader how the magic system works in the middle of characters doing things this isn't a video on succinctly delivering exposition i have two whole videos on that that i really recommend you go watch i'm really proud of them i actually think they're one of the best parts of the on writing series but this video is about pacing world building that halts the pacing tends to interrupt the scene to explain something so it makes sense and sometimes this is necessary but most of the time it isn't if you do need to do it repeatedly then chances are a you aren't trusting your readers to be smart enough to know what's happening or b you haven't explained things sufficiently beforehand in contrast world building that works with the pacing supports the emotional beats of the scene a piece of michael wright's numinous that i had the pleasure of editing did this beautifully and i know this is unconventional but it's really good as much as the intricate lines and patterns were beautiful they all meant nothing the sanctum tower and bailing bell was made in the image of one of gina's great towers before they had fallen but it was all form without function here only designed to try and echo how the first towers looked as much as nim wanted to laugh at the people's attempt of reproducing one of gina's great works it only made the immortal sad the emotional beat here is an immortal reflecting and longing for a golden age when a godlike being ruled the continent now only a shadow of its former self this beat helps us understand who the character is and the word building describing the architecture supports that emotional beat when world building interrupts you can remove the segway and the scene will still flow well when world building supports the pacing removing it would damage the flow or emotional beat of the scene go through your world building segways and ask if they interrupt or support the emotional beat and whether you're trusting your readers enough lastly though let's talk about pacing and genre and this i'm excited for because i really like this it's really nerdy it's cool specifically the young adult genre exemplified in books like paper towns they hate you give and it's a funny kind of story so basically what defines good pacing is not universal it's incredibly dependent on genre structure and pacing are conventionally tied together like this you've got to have a fast first act a slower second act and a fastest third act now while broadly true this isn't that helpful because different genres thrive on different speeds of pacing because different people get invested in stories in different ways i see that a lot different the contemporary young adult genre is an interesting case study in this let's look at the first chapter of john green's looking for alaska the first chapter features miles preparing to leave his boring world for boarding school because quote i go to seek a great perhaps that's why i'm going so i don't have to wait until i die to start seeking a great perhaps this is the hook an exciting question posed of what his adventure could hold but oddly enough the chapter is actually paced very slowly the sentences are long lumbering and can feel meandering conversation feels aimless on the surface but all of this is intentional the young adult genre revels in subtext and introspection which is what we see a lot of in green's work and other contemporary young adult novels these techniques give a heaviness to every thought and action of miles a depressing weight where life feels futile and sounds vacuous slow paced writing is important for investing readers in the personal arcs of your characters because it takes time to examine the thoughts and feel the consequences of their decisions and mistakes in a way that fast-paced writing really isn't equipped to do and contemporary young adult authors lean hard on this tactic because this is how their readership gets invested in a story often through issues that they can personally relate to like youth depression and suicide deep psychological introspection is what they're there for and it's also why it's a lot more common to find first person narration in contemporary ya like slower pacing it complements that method of getting readers invested compare this to the writing of lee child or robert ludlum authors in the spy and thriller genres which lean hard into fast pacing they attract different audiences and while fast-paced scenes do happen in waya like quentin desperately searching for margot on a ticking clock in green's paper towns contemporary yeah uses that slower pace because the actual events of the story are less immersive than the deeply personal psychological journey this often results in a slowly paced first second or even third act without it being bad pacing for the core narrative because they still feel that they're getting closer to the big thing that they're there for that they're invested in fundamentally good pacing is also about the audience that you're writing for and the kind of tension that you want to cultivate i could tell you to write a fast pace first act a slower second and fastest third but that wouldn't be good advice because each story is paced differently even on that level i can't tell you how to master pacing so you know in your story that readers feel they're getting closer to the big thing i can only help identify and help you get past the obstacles in doing so so to summarize firstly you can alter the pacing on a scene by scene level using sentence structure word choice action reaction framing and other techniques like cliffhangers introspection and removing filter words secondly high tension does not necessarily mean using fast paced techniques however it's effective to stretch the tension like this only a few times to highlight important moments thirdly the side quest problem arises when plot obstacles have no narrative reason to exist halting the pacing of the core narrative entirely consider whether an obstacle fundamentally alters the ending develops your mc or reveals part of a mystery to the reader as well as the ratio between page time and how big of a step this really is towards the big thing fourthly a subplot complicates the main plot supporting fast pacing by adding tension or slow pacing by adding emotional moments while a side quest halts the pacing of the core narrative entirely fifthly subtext enriches the reader's experience by accelerating the pace because the reader is continually following implicit points of intrigue and investigating the text sixthly world building segways work when they support the pacing through underpinning emotional beats segways that interrupt the pacing are often because authors don't trust their audience enough or they haven't made it clear enough and seventhly good pacing is also dependent on genre with action or thrillers leaning fast and contemporary young adult leaning slow know your audience whoa and there we come to the end of it wow i really enjoyed making this and i know this is not going to get as many views because it's like a technique one and people like learning about tropes but seriously the technique stuff is super super important that's where you're going to get good at writing i hope you enjoyed this i really loved learning about this one thank you so much for the suggestion if you want to support the channel please do consider doing so i really want to be you know wholly independent of pretty much ad revenue that would be so amazing uh and thank you to all of you the thousands of you i think i'm coming up on 8 000 books or something 9 000 books is like i don't know uh of the people who have bought on writing and world building seriously amazing thank you so much please do come follow me on social media that's where i chat with all the people you can ask me questions in the meantime stay nerdy and i will see you in the future you\n",

      "how many times do i need to say this history is complicated it's full of half-truths legends and way too many stories of zeus having affairs as animals our understanding of history comes from hundreds of oral records written records and now twitter and instagram speaking of which come follow me at these links down below that's where i answer the questions i'm pretty active on there it's pretty cool anyways history is not a timeline history is a big ball of wibbly-wobbly tiny why me stuff which is why today we're discussing world building a history and hopefully by the end of it you'll have a flowchart map to guide you in constructing a realistic multi-dimensional world history and the topic is super fitting because today's video is sponsored by world anvil and internet gym you might have heard of perfect for chronicling world histories and not only is it fantastic software but it's run by great people i would know we're friends on discord yeah but more on them later the first thing to understand is that what actually happened in history and what people think happened are two markedly different questions so to begin what actually happened and should an author start with the story and reverse engineer history or should they start with the world history before they move on to the story around 1914 granddaddy of fantasy tolkien began working on the family of ellis languages he is known for today his passion for linguistics goes so far that he even stated my work is fundamentally linguistic and inspiration the invention of languages is the foundation these stories were made rather to provide a word for the language than the reverse so with this given that elvis splits into about 17 different dialects tolkie knew that the elves would have to split into various groups throughout history to cause these linguistic changes for example tolkien wanted the avaran dialect to be one of the most distinct indicating that this was one of the oldest groups to split off which the avari did in the year 1105 of the year of the trees one of the earliest diversions of the elves tolkien made something he loved and anchor and devised a world history that would explain why some dialects are more similar or different in vocabulary syntax and grammar and building outward from an element or few elements that you really care about ensures a cohesive world that is realistically grounded because you're not shoving these things in later on and it places the unique world you want at the heart of the experience of the reader catering to a particular kind of audience who find unique world building a particularly immersive force in their enjoyment of the story but this is more of a world builders approach people like tolkien who are world first and story second and it's fine if you are like that but i think most people are writers first and world builders second i know i am octavia butler is and lois larry are what i mean here is that a second method of building a world history is extrapolating out of things necessary for your story margaret atwood wrote the handmaid's tale a story about a fallen america where the republic of gilead an oppressive patriarchal regime has risen with a particular focus on the woman's role as caregiver and mother to justify the story of this dystopia coming to be edward knew that an american civil war would need to take place after widespread infertility and that this war would use nuclear weapons in the far west leaving only the north west inhabitable and building outwards from events necessary to frame your story is a good way to ensure that the world building always supports the narrative though it does mean that the world building is often less of the experience of the reader it also helps make sure that the story doesn't feel shoved jarringly into the world which is an issue that i find world building first writers run into that's what the story can sometimes feel like whichever method you use you then build out what's from there the causes and the consequences with the most important ideas you have at its foundation so step one identify your anchors either world building elements you care about or events necessary for your story and build outwards from there and while this web model extrapolating outward from your anchors is an effective way to build a world history it can lead to one problem a one-dimensional history where a single event or a few events dictate way too much of your world building brandon sanderson is a fantastic world builder do not get me wrong the reason his worlds feel so lived in as he so masterfully ties the cultural magical political and economic dimensions of his world to one another soul casting magic in the way of kings allows for magicians to create food out of stone so armies are much more mobile with few logistical limits but at the same time when i read his books there's a distinctive feeling that too much of his world history and the world itself was defined by this cataclysmic event called the last desolation four thousand five 500 years ago that is a long time as in in that time span humanity has seen the rise and fall of the egyptian middle kingdom the greek city-states the han dynasty the birth and death of more religions than are alive today the colonial area and the life and death of brad pitt and phil denim even if there was a devastating cataclysmic war 4 500 years ago so much time has passed that its ramifications would be so abstracted from now that it'd be difficult to draw a causal connection between then and now culturally politically or economically one real world example of this is the story of the great flood which we see in the bible the epic of gilgamesh and so many other ancient cultures have similar stories there seemed to be this grand cataclysmic event that radically shaped how they lived at the time but it's very difficult to draw a strong causal connection between that event and how we live our lives and think now also i want to be clear that this is a criticism that can be leveled at tolkien but tolkien wrote his world history with an intentional degree of surrealism i feel whereas brandon sanderson does definitely go for a gritty realistic world history so we're dealing with kind of two different approaches understanding history means understanding there is no single history no single thing or person or event dominoed the rest of history so following a single chain of cause and consequence to create your world history will feel one-dimensional no history is more like a dozen chains all starting independently and then later intertwining with other chains popping up occasionally this is particularly something i notice with fantasy mythologies and magic systems or science fiction technologies like needle casting and altered carbon which often take a front and center role in the narrative relying too heavily on a few things to determine the rest of history or your world building can make a world feel static like it hasn't changed and it all sprung from that one thing and if there's one thing that history does do it's change except for zeus banging women as animals some things never change and why is that because history is complicated so instead we're gonna break it down we're gonna make it complex we're gonna start with what we'll call the six pillars of history politics culture technology economy geography and religion and this is step two tell your world history through each of these lenses writing out six timelines with vastly different perspectives that begin relatively independently of one another to remove any prime mover event with this your world testing doesn't just feel like a single timeline tracking one chain of cause and consequence but a multi-dimensional history and building on this idea that there is no one history each of these timelines will be experienced differently dependent on geography the european dark ages were a golden age of academia and technology for the muslim courts of damascus the ascent of the united states to a world power was a time of decline for britain in georgia martin's a song of ice and fire series to give a fictional example the two continents of westeros and essos have wholly different understandings of world history westeros sees the age of heroes as a time of magic and great men and women but essa sees the same time as one of terra with the ghiscari empire built on the backs of slaves rising to power yet both continents highlight the long night as a catastrophic ice age of sorts around the same time in their histories giving some shared legends and myths and cultural legacies between them in this way the long night is like the great flood stories of our world and the more levels you do the song continent versus continent kingdom versus kingdom even city versus city the more realistic it becomes looking at these six timelines from different perspectives how they experience them differently and that gives us step three identify the ways different regions see the timelines of the six pillars differently and the historical elements they share now though the six pillar timelines give multiple dimensions to your world history we can also use them to give multiple dimensions to individual events as well because no matter what category an event might fit into they always have causes and consequences on multiple levels which is something that a lot of people often forget they just say the war was caused by them wanting the land and it's like well okay but there's economic dimensions to that as well why did they need the land for their agriculture and also was it because of a nationalistic rise in the culture was it because there was a sacred religious land at one point there's so many dimensions to how these things happen and oftentimes i just read a history of a fictional world and it's given one cause and one consequence i mean look at our world world war one while there was a bunch of politicians advocating for war from the start there was a cultural glorification of war across europe and there was a fast out competing german industrial sector that they were kind of scared of caesar's assassination the senate was losing democratic power there was a cultural derivation of caesar as a person and the dispossessed poor were looking for an alternative form of government after the economic failure of the ruling class and caesar was looking like a pretty good king nice sharp cheekbones rise of the bronies i i can't explain that one i'm sorry that one's just a mystery for a good example let's look at edward's work where she doesn't rely on a simplistic understanding of history to give rise to gilead it wasn't just a patriarchal party that rose to power she extrapolates cultural and religious causes and conservative and reactionary leftist movements that led to it political causes and a crackdown on rights following a series of terrorist attacks and environmental causes that motivated the group to act and importantly the social causes when humans became mostly infertile except for a few women causing that shift in how people thought and wanted to live and it's through these key events that her world history didn't just become realistic but terrifyingly believable so step four ground your world history and forces of realistic change by giving at least three causes and consequences to each major event political cultural technological economic geographical or religious and one way to visualize this would be to draw connections between your six pillar timelines allowing you to easily see the relationship between these dimensions as they become intertwined it'll get messy but i mean what real timeline isn't and once you've worked out what actually happened you've got to work out what people think happened they're never the same thing because history is complicated though as a side note some writers do skip finding out exactly what happened and just skip to the historical accounts part of it just acknowledging that there is some ambiguity that they don't even know what happened this is what the elder scrolls does it just gives you a whole bunch of contradictory texts and it doesn't give you a clear answer technically speaking there is no canon interpretation there's just a whole lot of different interpretations that we've got to try and piece together to figure out what happened i really love that approach some writers do that some writers don't basically you don't need to know what exactly happened you could just acknowledge that people don't quite know we have different perspectives on it but you know that historical records are contradictory embellished and some people just think it's all hashtag fake news like the fact we went to the moon kidding i have to say i'm kidding because there'll be someone who didn't realize that i was kidding so instead we're going to look at four factors that answer how history gets like this and what leads to myths and legends the how the who the time and historical narratives number one how was history recorded for this we will have four levels oral history pictorial history written history and primary history oral history is kind of like a game of chinese whispers thousands of people long over centuries without the original person to tell you what they said in the first place and this is why so much of our really ancient history is so questionable homer's the iliad details the history of the trojan war and was communicated orally for a long time before being written down in the 8th century bc and while there is some historical evidence of a conflict during the bronze age the details have clearly been embellished across the years due to an inability to fact check and that we don't know how much information was lost or added full stop the second level is pictorial history by which i mean the recording of historical events in pictorial records through art architecture pottery or even tattoos egyptian hieroglyphs likely began as a language with this basis arguably it's even older than oral history but the reason that it is a step up is that pictorial history is static it is harder to alter and thus can be more trustworthy pictorial history may be wrong from the start but it does not forget and it is a lot harder to alter details carved into a mountain side than a story passed down through generations and the third level is written history it's static but it also allows for far greater detail than either oral or pictorial history and allows for multiple perspectives to be recorded more easily now it can be changed for example the written books of the new testament were translated and copied dozens of times throughout history to preserve it in that process from greek to latin to english some details or meaning were lost and a few were even arguably changed but in contrast pictorial history is extremely time and skill intensive and oral history requires an ongoing practice like the vedic chance of hinduism supported by a large group of people to keep it alive whereas written documents can survive more easily the dead sea scrolls found in 1946 were preserved for thousands of years without human assistance though as a side note i do want to mention that how widespread the ability to read and write is a really important factor if it's restricted to a certain class or gender or faction then it may be less effective at accurately recording historical events which we'll get to in a bit and the fourth level is primary history which includes audio and visual recordings as well as technologies like the internet with these technologies historical facts have never been easier to verify and records are incredibly static not only can we tell exactly what was said and seen at a time but the technology makes it a lot harder for stories to become embellished falsified facts forgotten or omitted because we remove the distance between us and the primary source we can look at the primary sources ourselves instead of trusting the written pictured or orally recorded second-hand sources of others though i do need to point out that the internet also makes it incredibly easy for anyone to send around misinformation even if that misinformation is easy to falsify to find out that it's wrong however when it comes to fantasy and science fiction there are some interesting complicating factors that might change how static our recording of history is for example some elves like galadriel and tolkien's legendarium are actually old enough to be eyewitnesses to ancient events that are recorded by very few people which we would expect to be falsified and embellished meaning their recollections may actually be relatively accurate donald's remember me features a technology capable of altering or wiping memories which is used to manipulate people into believing that they suffered tragedies they had certain relationships or saw certain things happen jk rowling's harry potter series has a magic system that involves a pensive where memories can be perfectly collected but also falsified like we saw with slughorn and the half-blood prince each of these offer fascinating world-building questions about how we can trust historical records when we can't even trust our own memories i would love to see a story go really deeply into that you could use this to fantastic thematic and narrative effect with plot twists and reveals so step 5 figure out how static the records of an event are with the level of technology recording it and embellish falsify or change the details accordingly the second factor to consider is who is recording the history for example did you know that kim jong-il was born atop a mountain his birth heralded by a swallow and when he arrived a star illuminated the sky winter changed a spring and a double rainbow arced across the sky it's a double rainbow look it goes all the way according to our glorious leader whom we would never question people nations and organizations have biases ideas they want to promote and suppress for personal interest the saxon records of the 793 viking raid of lindisfarne describes the vikings as coming with fiery dragons flying heathen men made lamentable havoc and other records describe them as demons the history of wars is written by the victor after all who recorded this history and which events they would alter change or emphasize due to their geopolitical position or character should be accounted for in your world history so step six consider how who records the history changes the way it is recorded and adjust your records accordingly and the third question is how much time has passed since the event records get more abstracted from the original account as time goes on as a general rule introducing emissions myths and falsities even in well-documented events despite world war ii happening only 80 years ago beliefs like france's failure to anticipate germany going around the megino line on the border still persist despite being able to verify that the imaginary line was designed to force germany through belgium which is exactly what happened but historical abstraction doesn't just happen through bias and the flaws of recording methods that we've been talking about over time the weird thing is is that humans are intrinsically interested in exploring why things happened more than just recording the facts which is why a lot of historical accounts tend to give some kind of conjecture along these lines this is why great ecological disasters were often turned into the mythological intervention of the gods and why myths about the maginot line persist because not only does this intrinsic desire become a problem when those recording it don't have all the facts but the simplest explanations are the ones easiest to pass on step 7 abstract records from truth to reflect time between the story and the event as well as the desire to explain why even without all the facts and necessarily you can't look at all these factors independently they all mesh together they work together to explain why history is this way you got to look at it overall and lastly i want to talk about historical narratives and how we identify with history what gives rise to myths and legends and the relationship that has to character motivation one narrative that you might have heard is that the capitalist united states defeated the communist soviet union in 1991 being a triumph for democracy and capitalism whether or not this is true the cold war has arguably shaped more of our political and economic ways of thinking than say what caused the fall of rome recent historical events and historical narratives are often more influential on what a character believes and they are motivated by even if they aren't true or older events they don't think about are actually more influential on their lives for example the ideas of the enlightenment and the french revolution are probably more responsible for how we live today but the threats and pressures of the cold war feel more immediate to people alive today because there are people who lived through the cuban missile crisis so they make decisions based on those pressures this is also why i tend to find ancient grudges between races like commonly with elves and dwarves to often feel contrived we tend to be more motivated by recent atrocities and historical narratives that we identify with that come from them a fictional example of this can be found in the fire nation in the last airbender it's not the history of the hundred year war that motivates citizens to continue to fight but the historical narrative that they were sold that this was the fire nation's benevolent way of sharing their prosperity with the world so what historical narratives are there in your story that people tell themselves whether true or not and how does that influence how characters think and act and feel motivated and a really interesting part of this is legends and myths they can spring up from misinformation or evolved records of history but they also rise from historical narratives rome's early history began with a war against the sabeinst in the north which was likely a border dispute between the tribes but rome always had this national historical narrative that their prosperity and triumph was blessed by the gods thus the records of rome's founding by romulus a son of the war god mars detailed that this war against the sabines was won not through strategy or the like but through the intervention of jupiter king of the gods the records of the sabine war which actually did happen aren't just altered due to time and recording flaws but a myth rises from it to reflect the historical narrative the romans wanted to believe and all of these factors are only complicated further by studies showing that our memories are unreliable at best after a short period inferring that they saw glass at a car crash even if there wasn't any truly meaning that we're more likely to accept answers that make sense to us for our historical narrative whatever their people's relationship with history is how would your fictional society see the arc of their history and how would this influence what legends and myths come

      "in my video on pacing we discussed the signed quest problem where obstacles in the plot may extend the story but ultimately don't contribute to narrative power from the end meaning those obstacles grind the story spacing to a halt like for example random segues where I say today's video is sponsored by curiosity stream which you can watch for free at WWE city stream calm such hello future me links down below flashbacks often face a similar pacing problem because the reader is forced to step away from the core narrative what is often called the front story to learn about the past something often unrelated with stakes that they may not care about now this doesn't need to be the case but I want to be clear about this the most important question about flashbacks and backstory before you put them in your book is this part one should it be included at all one of the most common mistakes that I see is write as thinking that because there is backstory it must be communicated but it's false no way this one was invented by a writer the skill is in knowing which stuff to include and which stuff to summarize or leave out so let's look at a good example in the Great Gatsby by if scott Fitzgerald the character Gatsby is desperately in love with a daisy who is married to another man and all the wealth he makes in the story is to win her over and in a flashback as detailed as any other dramatic scene in the book Fitz Jo takes the time to recount how gets be thought himself worthless when he met her as a penniless man without a past and yet because he managed to disguise that through his military uniform they shared a passion at time together Fitzgerald works to show us what John Truby would call Gatsby's ghost the source of the hero's psychological and moral weakness believing that his wealth is his worth now you might conclude from this example that if it's a defining moment for your character it should be included but once again is toe pure fiction it's fiction the distinction is relevance to the narrative while this backstory helps us understand why Gatsby is the way he is his ghost that's not all it is the tension in the Great Gatsby comes from Gatsby's reckless pursuit of Daisy that ultimately culminates in his death and the theme of the story is about the failure of the American Dream rags to riches this flesh pack is crucial to understanding both of those things by heightening the narrative tension around Gatsby's reckless pursuit and developing the major theme of how easy and toxic it is to associate wealth with happiness now this is a pretty broad rule but what I'm trying to get at here is that flashbacks that work don't only provide backstory exposition whether they're sympathetic or not they have to provide something else as well often helping develop theme or tension for the narrative payoff which is why flashbacks so often relate to a character arc because we derive tension from those in the story backstory that just gives more information about a character doesn't necessarily feel that relevant to the narrative and thus slows the pacing and to be honest there are more efficient ways of explaining motivation or inspiring sympathy for a character that don't require the reader to step away from the front story and risk stalling the pacing especially because showing how the emotional experiences of a character's past affects them now is often more moving for a reader backstory like a lot of world-building is like an iceberg the reader may only see parts relevant to the story even if the author knows that there's a lot more down there and this is why the fact that anime gives every single secondary character an entire episode of Banks story can be so frustrating but I personally feel that relevance to the narrative is a pretty high bar when it comes to flashbacks in my book a character has a traumatic backstory but I never actually flashback to those traumatic events themselves even though they have intense dramatic emotional weight and they ask seme related to the themes of the story this is because depicting it wouldn't actually help understand the character or directly build tension because the story is really about the struggles of dealing with trauma in the years after and I want to develop empathy based on those experiences not simply the trauma itself now it wouldn't be bad writing to include it but I just don't think there's the justification there needed for it even for such a major event for one of my main characters and if I did include it I fear it could be kind of gratuitous but there are two exceptions that I want to touch on firstly you want to include it this is your book your creative control matters if you want to include those flashbacks and your passion about it go for it secondly it's a different case for parallel stories which take place in two different time frames like arrow if you are creating a whole story arc with these flashbacks then they don't necessarily need to be relevant to the other storyline because it's ultimately an independent narrative whereas a fictive flashbacks exist to support the core narrative that being said part two two kinds of flashbacks so you've figured out which parts of your backstory need to be included as flashbacks but how long and detailed should they be well there are kind of two different types of flashback on a spectrum as methods of exposition delivery half scenes and full scenes and they each serve different purposes narrative Lee let's look at how author John Green uses these two different types the opening of Paper Towns where Quentin and Margo find a dead body as children is a full scene flashback it's got all the sensory detail any other part of the story would have it's long at 1500 words it's not summarized and it's even separated into its own chapter this does two things a it signals to the reader that this part of his backstory is particularly relevant to the front story in a way that characters simply recounting the event might not be and be the extra detail gives these moments more dramatic emotional waits than a character simply summarizing the event would I recommend checking out my prologues video if you want more specific advice on when to use a flashback as your prologue like Green does here in contrast consider this half same flashback in The Fault in Our Stars where hazel recalls spending an afternoon with her father in a river just in conversation it's briefly summarized it's short at less than 150 words and as few lines of quoted dialogue half scenes a useful for less important moments of backstory that still give insight into characters but they don't risk disrupting the pacing because they take the reader away from the front story flashbacks don't need to be as long or short as these but figuring out which elements of your story are important enough to be full scenes and which should be half scenes is up to you as the writer just consider those four factors narrative importance dramatic emotional weight insight into character and pacing how much less impactful would Snape's memories of Lily's be in the deathly hallows as a half scene instead of a full scene and how annoying would it be to get repeated flashbacks to Ron's past part three making flashbacks work in Harry Potter and the half-blood Prince Harry spends a lot of time persuading Professor Slughorn to tell him what he told Tom Riddle about making Horcruxes slow corn gave Dumbledore a fake memory but eventually gives up the real one to Harry and the story has a full scene flashback to the past even though told from the perspective of Harry it is fundamentally Bank story but it works for a couple of reasons firstly mystery Rowling takes careful page time to invest the reader in a question what did Slughorn tell Voldemort we wonder and she gives an answer in a flashback Brandon Sanderson talked about this technique and saying flashbacks let you build a mystery and then answer it or build a mystery and then continue it in an interesting way so it's often more about the information that the reader knows you're withholding from them rather than the information that you give them secondly Rowling's flesh banks actively move their narrative forward instead of slowing the pacing when flashbacks work well they are adding to the forward momentum of the story by giving the reader the information they need to understand the context of what's at stake the backstory doesn't only build theme or tension like in The Great Gatsby but Rowling structured her stories so that learning what Slughorn told riddle actively moves the story into the third act by establishing new stakes destroying a Horcrux it doesn't just feel like we're halting the pacing at all fundamentally some flashbacks work because though they step away from the front story chronologically they stay with it in terms of narrative momentum so give the flashbacks something to change your story going forward maybe it reveals a foreshadowed secret or it introduces a new problem now there are some pretty broad guidelines about not having flashbacks in the first 50 pages or the first five chapters buds are made up - it's a total fabrication it's true that randomly splicing flashbacks across your story will be jarring for the reader and stall the pacing so a lot of writing advice tends to focus on how to best segue into a flashback through a book or a dream or a triggered memory when a character see something that sort of thing but how you seek way in that sense really doesn't matter if you get it right in terms of part for scene structure one of the things that a nonlinear narrative does for you is it allows you to present the narrative pieces in the order that the audience needs for maximum emotional impact story structure is less about the chronology of your story and way more about controlling the order in which the reader experiences things with this in mind a common structure used for flashback scenes is placing them so that they comment on or give a deeper context to the front story scene either immediately before it or immediately after it in the last airbender we see a number of flashbacks to Aang's past during the episode the southern air temple in particular the center around Aang's relationship with monkey and so his mentor but the scene is almost immediately followed up by the discovery of monk Gyatso's corpse the flashback hero not only built into the episodes tension of Eng discovering the genocide of us people but it gave extra context and emotional weight to the specific scene in the front story that followed it the let's take scene structure to a deeper level in writing fiction for dummies Randy Ingham ascend highlights two different types of scenes proactive scenes where a character has a goal a conflict and a setback or resolution and in reactive scenes which are those that follow proactive scenes with a reaction a dilemma and a decision you'll notice these in your own writing but flashbacks are often seamlessly incorporated into reactive scenes here's how in the last time we say goodbye by cynthia hand the character licks is struggling to stop blaming herself for the suicide of her brother in this hand writes a proactive scene where leox has a goal trying to stop another boy taking their own a conflict she has to break into his house and a setback she finds out that her brother called this boy the night he died the reactive scene that follows perfectly segues into a flashback of the night her brother died we see her reaction this is a deep shock she faces a dilemma she doesn't know how to deal with her intense emotions and she makes a decision she processes them by journaling her memory of the night he died flash banks often detail the emotional make up or explain the thinking of a character so they very naturally fit into exploring the emotional reaction that they have for how they deliberate on the dilemma by showing how they've dealt with things in the past or how Cynthia hand does it by integrating it into the decision part fundamentally how usig way into a flashback is a lot less important than where you fit it into your scene structure and narrative overall if you get that right I honestly don't think it matters that much though I will bring up one technique mentioned by youtuber shale and rights and a video linked down below about filter words filter words are verbs like realized notice - remembered for calls they remind the reader that they are being told about a thing rather than being shown consider this passage in rainbow Rowell's eleanor and park a park end thought about that either the first time he saw Eleanor on the bus he remembered thinking that was bad enough that she looked the way she did he remembered feeling embarrassed for her and now now he felt the fight rising up in his throat these terms remind the reader that they're being told about something rather than showing them it imagine if it was written like this but Parkin thought about that either the first time he saw Eleanor the bus he thought it was bad enough that she looks the way she did he felt embarrassed for her and now it was a fight rising up in his throat this feels more immersive because there isn't an extra layer put between the reader and the characters experiences so rather than using filter words to begin the flush Bank considered just starting it so long as you indicate when this happened also if anyone's ever told you to just use italics when you're in a flashback boss no way not this time but sometimes a flashback doesn't serve to comment on or give a deeper context to the front scene before or after it but that doesn't mean it's useless part five recontextualization in teaching story of your life the narrative is repeatedly interrupted by a series of odd scenes the film adaption of this 2016's arrival depicts these scenes as flashbacks for the main character but the short story depicts them more as a woman imagining her future daughter's life and then there will be times when I see you laughing like the time they'll be playing with the neighbours puppy but I'm not sleepy your whine it that sort of thing but what matters here is that these are nonlinear scenes they take us out of the chronological narrative which is the character talking to the aliens and they don't really provide any extra context or depth to the front story immediately around them until the end now spoilers for one of the best sci-fi stories and films ever made but it turns out that these nonlinear scenes are actually flash forwards in time because as the front story progresses the main character develops the ability to see parts of the future and she now knows that her daughter the future daughter is going to die young at this point the front story entirely recontextualizes our understanding of these nonlinear scenes with a twist at the end littering these scenes across the story was still crucial to the narrative pay off in the emotional weight of the story and the themes behind it it just wasn't immediate like we see in the half-blood prince avatar robbed my diary from the edge of the world and if it wasn't littered throughout the story then it wouldn't have been nearly as effective if we showed these ideas after we found that out and because he knew that there wasn't going to be immediate payoff teaching employs a couple of techniques to keep the reader engaged he writes these non-linear scenes in second person present teens for the most part you do this you do that and though it reads like a woman imagining the future it feels off because not only would we usually read this kind of scene in past tense or future tense but the woman suddenly imagines her daughter dying something that no hopeful mother would usually do the reader immediately understands that there's something weird going on here Ching subtly introduces a question that he answers at the end and if you're going to pip a backstory throughout the book then this is a good model building a mystery around them keeps them interesting now remember that quote we had from before about using flashbacks to change chronological order and maximize emotional impact yeah story of your life is a fantastic example of this for that reason bringing us to part six trauma it's difficult to talk about flashbacks without address in the context and which they're often used traumatic experiences in the past now this isn't the video to get into a meditation or analysis about the social complexities around that I've actually made a video on writing mental illness it is the best video I've ever made it's linked up in the corner and I really would appreciate your going to watch that if you are interested in their topic but um flashbacks are often used to show the origins of trauma particularly through repressed memories and they are effective as full scenes for all the reasons that we've just discussed they make clear how important this moment is and afforded the dramatic emotional waves that it probably deserves but a couple of things here one in terms of developing reader empathy for a character trauma is just as much about how it affects them now as it is what happened in their past that's something I see a lot of writers kind of miss discussing the traumatic flashbacks in a short story medline am Ali Matar said what I wanted to do was to really dive deep into the sensory effects of the story so that you get a sense of what it would be like to have this really dislocating and terrifying thing happen to you and when she's saying this she's recognizing the flashbacks in the context of trauma aren't just a narrative device to look back on the past they're a visceral emotional and psychological experience for someone looking at how a panic attack in a flashback might happen at the same time describing the feeling of certain triggering things like if a victim of abuse was grabbed by the wrist by another character it might cause a flashback but describing the actual feeling of being grabbed is really important to understanding the traumatic context here and as I said before in my book I'm not even showing those maduk events and flesh Bank because I want my story to be about how they deal with those things now and the struggles around that secondly memories are not necessarily accurate or concrete and this is especially true for traumatic or repressed ones and they don't usually come all flooding back at once and one grand narrative reveal now that doesn't make it bad writing to have accurate flashbacks or to have a lot of memories all come back at once but you can use an unreliable narrator for effect just remember that people often have nebulous memories nebulous nebulae that reminds me it was a gray summer day when I discovered nebula a video platform with creators like just right lessons from the screenplay Lindsey Ellis and others it was a land of milk and honey there were no ads at all meaning it was built by and for creators and this magical place nebula I'm on there as well now and I know how you can try it for free through curiosity stream the subscription service were thousands of documentaries like the one that I was watching on that same grace on a day that the seemingly fantastical tale of Hannibal's march on Rome crossing mountains were the war elephants to march against the greatest empire the world had ever seen normally curiosity stream is $2.99 a month but if you go to dub dub dub curiously stream calm slash hello future me and use hello future me as your code and sign up you'll get both curiosity stream and nebula for free for a month go chickened out down below in summary firstly like we're building not all banks story needs to be communicated a good test is whether it is relevant to the narrative helping develop tension and core theme this is often through showing the reader the ghost relevant to a character arc secondly flashbacks can be written as half scenes or full scenes the more narrative importance the dramatic emotional weight inside the character of extra moment hairs the more detailed it should be but the longer it is the more likely it will slow pacing thirdly flashbacks are often made more effective by generating intrigue and mystery around them before they are revealed one way to avoid pacing issues is to use them to move the story forward by establishing new stakes introducing a new problem changing a character's position in the story altering how the story works going forward fourthly flashbacks can be used to manipulate story chronology for maximum emotional impact this is often done by a using a flashback to comment on the front scene immediately before or after it and be using one in a reactive scene following practicing's either in the reaction dilemma or decision stages fifthly filter words usually make flashbacks lists immersive these are words like remembered felt and recalled what matters is indicating when it takes place sixthly flashbacks don't need to comment on the front story scene if they're going to be wholly recontextualized by the end through a twist they still assist in narrative payoff however developing a mystery across them will will help keep them interesting till that point and seventh trauma flashbacks can be used to explore trauma but the experience of trauma is often just as much about how it affects them now as it is what happened repressed memories are often unreliable have gaps or psychologically painful to recall but that is all for me now you'd expect that I'd be saying thank you for the money that we raised last week on the charity stream but I'm filming this before then because I didn't want to screw myself over work and have to try and pump this out videos that I work really hard on in like under a week after doing a 24 hour stream it didn't think that's possible but thank you for the money that we raised we raised this amount yeah really impressive so go right figure out you want to use flashbacks stay nerdy and I'll see you in the future [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you\n",

      "let's talk about Twilight by Stephenie Meyer it's a first-person novel from the perspective of Bella Swan that has werewolves vitamin D deficiency derp Diggory and problems like if vampires don't have blood circulation then how does it would get ha no we won't be talking about that we'll be discussing the first person all this at all these points and go into a little bit of weird Twilight falls short as a first-person narrative and while edward can watch Bella sleeping at her window for free you can watch today's sponsor curiosity stream for free at dubbed a boob your SD streamed COMSAT hello future me links down below first person writing is when you write from inside the mind of a particular character in their words using the pronouns I or we I dove into a rosebush we were ten we didn't know what happened after you died hell I still don't know now you're here so you're probably already considering using the first person so we'll jump straight to the core of first person writing its biggest challenge and its biggest advantage character voice first person writing means getting deep inside the mind of a character in a way you just really can't in the third person it gives you what we call the closest psychic distance of any perspective between character and reader and a uniquely allows them to really engage with that character because of this it's best for stories which are a psychological and that a lot of time is spent on introspection or internal monologue or be only one character's journey is central to the narrative if so then maybe it's view which is great but you are giving up the ability to describe scenes and places however you like because you'll be describing them through the lens of that particular character the way they would and that's a restriction but really good first-person novels can be just as engaging when you have a strong character voice telling the story a unique and interesting way the character engages with the world around them and allows the reader to engage with it too a fantastic example of this is in Brandon Sanderson's skywards which I've just started reading a lot of the rocks in the tunnel were broken and cracked most likely from Krell bombings I imagine those rocks has their broken bodies of my enemies their bones shattered their trembling arms reaching up in a useless gesture of total and complete lead to defeat this passage bleeds with character telling us how the Kevins looked while also characterizing the narrator Spencer it tells us she has an active imagination a fixation on the battle her people are fighting that she's okay with violence and has an intense desire to be a hero all of which has proved true in the later chapters now this writing isn't as complicated or poetic prose as you might have in third person but it's just as vivid and that makes it immersive however and I want to touch on this because I know my audience this close psychic distance does present a particular problem for soft magic systems it would be really difficult to write the Lord of the Rings from the first-person perspective of Gandalf who solves problems using magic and not telling the reader how it works when they're literally inside the mind of Gandalf can feel jarring like they've been cheated if a soft magic system is critical to the feel of your world the Wonder the unknown then perhaps first-person isn't for you or alternatively right from the perspective of someone who isn't a magic user this is what Patrick Ness in the rest of us just live here did so how do you develop a strong character voice well it's not as simple as having interesting characters we'll break it down into two parts unreliable narrators in language firstly the unreliable narrator to be very clear having an unreliable narrator doesn't mean that they're actively lying or hiding things from the reader heavy rain style what it means is that your first person character almost certainly cannot be objective when telling their story so ask yourself eh what does your protagonist focus on or notice in describing and B what do they not care about or miss to me these are the two most important questions that frame your character's voice so try and answer them for your character in The Handmaid's Tale offerd longs for a time before the tyrannical Gilead so her descriptive prose focuses on relics of the past we slipped in what had once been the gymnasium for the games that were formally played there I looked up at the ceiling tracing the foliage of the wreath today it makes me think of a head that women used to wear at some period during the old days but Offred is also a relatively of character who doesn't revolt against the regime so her descriptive focus isn't usually on threats escape routes she doesn't describe the war that she hears about contrast this with Spencer's perspective and sentence skyward who is an active character and a fighter who sees the world through their lens and a really relevant example for a lot of literature these days is that a mentally ill person is going to have a markedly different framing for what they focus on or don't focus on or they miss to someone who isn't find biases that will frame your characters storytelling in any given scene find something they might focus on something they might miss something they might summarize its to detailing or something they might hide and characters can also be unreliable because as but mere mortals they're lying to themselves or they're just wrong John Green's Paper Towns is packed with the internal monologue of Quinton thinking about another character a girl called Margo now because it's written from his perspective he paints a picture of this girl for the reader and the reveal at the end of the book is just how incorrect this imagining of her was he was completely wrong about her their degree of uncertainty is really interesting for a reader to engage with and then on a more specific level character voice is also about language see characters will use particular words phrases and analogies to describe things in a way characteristic of them in Skyward Spencer sometimes uses language that has this battlefield method theme with similes and metaphors that often draw on legends and stories but it's also often about the word choice and sentence structure itself that color first-person storytelling with character in the knife of never letting go by Patrick Ness more complicated words like education are spelled like this this not only reminds us of how the protagonist Todd Hewitt never received a full education but the fact that he can't read or write that well is a big insecurity for his character and this literally puts that insecurity into the way the story is written language gives character voice because it indicates class age sitting and character find words or phrases that your character will use more often and more importantly particular analogies for metaphors or similes they might use to tell the story to do with maybe seasons history sexuality nature in the case of my book the main character uses physics now I said we're gonna talk about Twilight so let's talk about Twilight I can't believe I'm doing this you've almost definitely heard that Bella is not a particularly interesting first-person protagonist unlike Spencer Todd Hewitt or Offred Bella doesn't really have any defining language and analogies or vocabulary and there isn't a strong subjectivity in her descriptions or her storytelling she focuses on what moves the plot fort and not what she would as a character well if she had anything to focus on as a character in other words she doesn't really have a strong character voice and it shows there's never a distinct feeling that she is narrating the story in a sense that someone else would not tell the story the same way a first-person story it may be but there's not much person in the story first-person means you generally aren't able to wax poetic Lee like a third person writer mind but you get to make that up with an equally immersive character voice but Stephenie Meyer has neither the strong prose of a third-person novel nor the unique lens of a first-person one rendering much of her writing kind of colorless like a newscaster reporting on the daily events [Music] greetings welcome this is the 6 o'clock news today my mother drove me to the airport with the windows rolled down it was 75 degrees in Phoenix the sky a perfect cloudless blue I was wearing my favorite shirt a sleeveless white eyelet lace I was wearing it as a farewell gesture my carry-on item was a parka back to you Jim yet that that that's a quote from the book but hey speaking of robber Penson da okay I have been trying for like half an hour to come up with a joke that connects Robert Pattinson to exposition and I just can't if you can think of one let me know down below anyways first person writing in exposition delivering exposition is hard enough in any given perspective watch my two video is dedicated to it but first person adds an extra layer of difficulty because it can be jarring if your character goes out of their way to describe something that you would not expect them to that they wouldn't usually usually mundane things like their day job their clothes how their house looks or their physical description leading to the curse said I looked at myself in the mirror seen at the start of way too many novels one good way to solve this is with what I call the difference vector in The Hunger Games the first chapter has the characters dressing up formally for the reaping a big event in their society and Collins writes of course let's put your hair up to she says a little towel dried and braided up on my head I can hardly recognize myself in the cranked mirror that leans against the wall you look beautiful says permanent voice and nothing like myself I say now this is literally a first-person character describing themselves in a mirror but it's not jarring because the description isn't focused on what is mundane and normal but what is different in a laboratory to braid that Katniss doesn't usually have a counter describing how something mundane sounds different looks different or means something different to them allows first-person narrators to explore things they usually wouldn't so if there is something obvious mundane or uncharacteristic that you want them to talk about consider how you might make it different so that they would but you'll also notice in this passage that it doesn't tell us that much explicitly about what Candice looks like a little bit about her here and that's it and that's because of something called inference where Raiders conclude things from your writing that are not explicitly stated first-person writers use inference a lot more than third-person writers because the author doesn't have the same freedom to describe or tell you anything they want just as the characters view of the world is very limited so is the readers taking a Katniss example it wouldn't make sense for her to go on a detailed spiel about how she looks but just by being told that she looks nothing like herself here with a tied up braid a dress and very clean the reader can infer what she might look like rough hands from work perhaps sometimes dirty wearing simple and comfortable clothes a very real physical description without ever saying it likewise inference applies to describing places or things in the world itself because your narrator might not characteristically go into detail about something so instead you describe the small things and leave readers imagine the large things the small things are going to be very individual to what you're going to see that other people wouldn't what I mean here is that character might only describe one part of something like one street in a city and the key is controlling what your readers will infer from that description what is your phrasing imply about the things around it about the things that aren't described explicitly consider this passage from The Great Gatsby my own house was an eyesore but it was a small eyesore and it had been overlooked so I had a view of the water a partial view of my neighbor's lawn and the consoling proximity of millionaires all for $80 a month Fitz Jordan you the his narrator's character voice would focus on how cheap it was one part of this but he doesn't just describe that his house was run down with a fetch roof and had broken cobblestones instead he phrases it so that we infer how grand and beautiful dimensions are around it Rapunzel might only describe a single Tower of a castle James Bond only the smell of cigarettes in a room or Shrek how many onions there are at a dinner and what they taste like and how many layers they have did I go too far with that metaphor in first person description pick an element that your character will focus on and in phrasing that consider what you want the audience to imagine and infer around that inference will be a bigger part of how your world and characters feel in first-person and to be clear that isn't a bad thing sometimes the reader will imagine things way better than you will ever describe them isn't that right Grindelwald hard mmm this is also kind of the trek behind the unknowable horrors of love crafty and gods now this doesn't mean that your character won't sometimes describe everything about a place or an event but a lot of the time they won't so inference is a good skill to develop thirdly confiding in the reader a third-person story might describe the insecurities or secrets of a character but a first-person narrator uniquely chooses to trust the reader with their secrets directly and that is a very different dynamic you can show the difference between the character's internal life and how they present to others through revealing insights such as hopes fears prejudices and regrets that your character might not be so quick to admit in their dialogue in essence your characters internal narrative builds a secondary dialogue that only your readers are meant to hear for example one of the opening lines in what remains of Edith Finch is my brother Milton disappeared when I was four it was like the house just swallowed him up her first line here is choosing to confide in the reader about a family tragedy there's a vulnerability that comes with that and you can't help but want to be there to listen when this person wants to confide in you and that's what first-person stories can do confessions make for great opening lines and facilitate that uniquely personal relationship between character and reader what this means is that there's really kind of two narratives and first-person stories that you really can't get in third-person and that's awesome so you use it consider finding something your narrator can confide in the reader about in your first chapter that helps set the stage for the rest of the story fourthly the importance of first-person medium character voices about who is writing this but medium is about a why they're writing it and B the method in which they're doing so the last time we say goodbye by cynthia hand eventually reveals that the book is written as part of a character's therapy after blaming herself for the loss of her brother which is why the character rights so purposefully to confront her difficult emotions in the ending as framed as her trying to come to peace with it all just like character voice will change what they focus on or exclude so will why they are writing it likewise the Handmaid's Tale is revealed to be a series of audio recordings which is why the narrative is loose meandering and conversational often going on random tangents in the name of the wind --kavitha is recounting his legendary tales as a bard with music so it's not really surprising that it has incredibly poetic prose that first-person narratives don't usually have just like character voice and the wide change how it's written so will the medium lastly basic techniques now a lot of other people have covered this before so I didn't want to focus on it but two really good tips to remember that I found helpful are a removed filter words filter words put what we talked about before psychic distance between the reader and the character reminding them that they are actually being told a story their words like imagined saw felt touched consider this passage from yeah Twilight I felt image Stefan nixed me and I wondered at his reaction to the word it meant something more to the three of them now let's rephrase it amid Stefan next me a strange reaction to the word it means something more to the three of them by removing the filter words felt and wondered the reader really feels like them more there and the sentences carry more of a punch we also don't need Bella to tell us that she wondered about the word it's clear from the context that she already is secondly use the implied I in first-person I is the dominant pronoun but using it too much can be repetitive and jarring for the reader so remove it and to take another example from Twilight instead of writing after I brush my teeth I worked a straighten out the tangle that was my here I splashed my face with cold water right after brushing my teeth I splashed my face with cold water and work to straighten out the tangled cows of my hair the eye here is implied where it isn't used and the sentence flows more smoothly but before we get into the summary I want to tell you about nebula a video platform made by and for creators and I am a part of it alongside other people like Lindsey Ellis TSO and listens from the screenplay it helps support us all and I know how you can try it for free through curiosity stream the subscription service with thousands of documentaries like Esther alien tic about this mind-blowing celestial object that came

go and check it out down below now in summary of all of the awesome stuff that we've talked about today one first person gives you the closest psychic distance of any perspective but you give up the ability to tell the story however you like just as the characters perspective is limited so is the readers it is best suited to psychological stories all those with a single central character secondly develop a strong character voice by asking what your characters focus on miss and which words phrases or metaphorical analogies they would characteristically use this unique lens ensures the story is being told in a way that only that character could thirdly use the difference factor to give first-person narrators describing mundane things that they would not usually consider what you want readers to infer from the limited descriptions the or character might give fourthly confiding the readers a first-person tool that establishes a unique dynamic of trust between character and reader who cannot help but want to listen confessions also make for fantastic opening lines fifthly why someone is giving the first-person account and the medium in which they do it will also feed how it is presented phrased and it's folk and lastly remove filter words that damage the psychic distance between the read and character used the implied I to make sentences punchier and flow more smoothly and like Bella

      "strange women lying in ponds distributing swords is no basis for a system of government but what if it was let's talk about world building monarchies and you can get today's sponsor that i use dashlane for 30 days free over at dub dub dub dashlane such hellofuture main links are all down below we're going to be getting into all of this today which is a lot so uh let's just jump into it part one types of monarchy there are kinda two different types of monarchy and they arise from different economic political and cultural environments you can have succession monarchs where a relative of the current monarch takes the crown after them and though you're likely familiar with patrilineal primogeniture where the elder sun inherits it all which relative is chosen often differs from system to system i've got a lot of them up on the screen now a successive monarchy usually arises from a single family controlling a population centers and b important resources not necessarily the largest swath of land though they often did because historically controlling large spots of land meant controlling resources consider this map of norway in 930 ce harold controlled almost the smallest portion of norwegian land but all of the main population centers and much of the fishing trade with the rest of scandinavia the imbalance of power here allowed harold to exert force on those around him and enforce a successive monarchy but the question of who inherits the throne in a successive monarchy is characterized by a mix of social and cultural norms the emphasis on male succession in most cultures is deeply rooted in the traditional male role of being a warrior politically required for leadership in the past in contrast some south western areas of japan practiced ultimatum and the edo period where the youngest son not the eldest inherits the most or at least inherits the heart of it this was because of a cultural norm that valued caring for the elderly which the youngest child would be the one left doing perhaps in your world only females can do something incredibly important to leadership in your world hashtag women can be dictators too or the religious value of older age means that it passes to the elder sibling regardless of their gender consider what societal pressures or cultural norms may change what leadership requires in your world and thus to whom succession would pass in particular things like magic systems technology and advanced social structures act as equalizers between the sexes ages or anyone else even making them fitter for the throne the world building question for you is which factors in your world act as equalizers for people or change what is required of a leader thus changing how succession should work alternatively you could have the second type elective monarchies you don't vote for kings where a body elects an individual usually from amongst themselves to become high king or king they will usually serve for life though not always and then a new king's moot will be called to pick the next one the vatican is probably the most famous example of this the pope is voted in by cardinals in a long very complex procession however and this is important to know an elective monarchy doesn't mean that hereditary claims mean nothing many success of monarchies begin as elected monarchies and then evolve the holy roman empire the bohemians and the dutch may have elected their kings but it was nearly always from among a single family with far more influence than the rest of the electors truly elected monarchies did not last very long as being in a position of executive power allowed the family to acquire immense influence and wealth eventually allowing them to emerge as the most powerful faction ensuring there is election making the election more of a rubber stamp in that case it becomes more of a tradition in a successful monarchy than its own system there are lots of questions about how they elected and who buy but the bigger world building question for you is what keeps your elective monarchy from devolving into a hereditary one perhaps there are some of the democratic checks and balances that we have today term limits that being a king means you don't own land and wealth or maybe candidates for kings have to be sterile or gay the ottoman empire vietnamese dynasty and chinese dynasties all gave a lot of political power to eunuchs who couldn't have children because they believed them less vulnerable to corruption and seduction otherwise it could be wholly different and random it can be whatever you want we're in a narco-syndicalist commune we take it in turns to act as a sort of executive officer for the week perhaps candidates are trialed against one another hunger games style like they are in generations the savior's champion or there's a certain set of character criteria like for how they find the next dalai lama a religious leader see the role of succession isn't just about who is king but it's about preventing civil war in disputes over who should be king it's about continuity of government if the conflict is likely to come from within the family then a blood-related succession is probably better fit but if it's likely to come from houses challenging the throne then maybe an elective monarchy ask yourself where the conflict and succession is most likely to come from but thirdly with a successive elective or something else constitutionalism is asking whether there is a legal agreement with any other body limiting the powers of the monarch now the degree to which your monarch is restrained will entirely depend on your society being anywhere from near absolutism to merely ceremonial but constitutional monarchies are often peered with a comparative rising economic quality a merchant class and a shrinking peasant class see the spread of wealth often coupled with an industrial revolution creating more skilled workers means that a significant class of people are educated and can demand more of a say leading to a constitutional agreement though there are examples like the magna carta that show it can happen long before that point is if there is a constitutional agreement then there's going to be a social economic context that it comes from usually the world building questions for you are a what are the interests of the group that bind the monarch for example the glorious english revolution of 1688 was partly motivated by protestants seeking to restrain an ardently catholic monarch king james this led to the constitutional right of protestants to bear arms for their defense suitable to their conditions and preventing the establishment of ecclesiastical courts designed to punish those against catholicism and b which powers matter in your society historically focus has been on the powers of legislation judicial jurisdiction the courts taxation and control of the military these are kind of the pillars of governmental powers but some countries had restrictions over the appointment of religious authorities for example the distribution of land or even the right to organize labour unions in russia following the 1905 revolution which rights powers or liberties are crucial to how your society works it could be anything in which case it's likely these would factor into constitutional agreements part 2 de jure versus de fato power the question of world building is just as much how is power legally divided as it is how is power factually divided a state may be a monarchy of some kind but the actual web of power behind it may lie somewhere else the prince of pentos in a song of ice and fire is a de joure by law elected monarch but the real power rests in the hands of a small number of nobles called magisters making it a de facto aristocratic monarchy alternatively the real power could be in the hands of the wealthy like the empire of japan prior to world war ii making it a plutocratic monarchy the earth kingdom in avatar the last seabender is a bureaucratic monarchy where legally the power lies in the hands of the king but the real power lies in the hands of the bureaucracy surrounding him other dynamics include stratocratic monarchies like the roman empire technocratic monarchies which may work for those in science fiction theocratic monarchies or even metocratic monarchies where wizards hold the real power in fantasy having a combination of two or three systems of government creates a really interesting de joure de facto dynamic to explore and adds an extra layer of complexity to your world because power structures are almost never as simple as the de joure way it looks consider how your democracy is meant to work versus where you feel it may be biased and towards whom i'll just leave that question hanging but in designing this you can't just pick whichever ones you want in world building the question of de joure and de facto power will be closely linked to social structure and the economic system of your society in dragon age the archon may be the usually hereditary monarchical figure of the tevinter imperium but it's a strict racial class system with elves being viewed as racially inferior as well as a magical hierarchy above that it is also a slave-based economy and while the archon may be the legal head of it all a majority of the workforce resources and wealth through slave ownership is controlled by other powerful human mages making the state a monarchic mecocracy a war economy will have a strong relationship with the de facto stratocratic leadership a communist social structure will have strong de facto working-class representatives behind the throne if there is an aristocracy that somehow survived the glorious revolution a strong capitalist economy would have ceos who own massive companies that control more resources and more of the workforce than the monarch perhaps the world building question is this a monarchy may be at the heart of your society but how is the workforce the wealth the resources and the social capital organized and the rest of society that will tell you who is de facto in charge see the fundamental fact behind all of this is that even absolutist monarchies are never truly absolute monarchs exist at the center of a web of power but that web around them is made out of businessmen nobles family members the military academics the church and so much more depending on your world mad king aerys ii in a song of ice and fire the mad king was really being kept in power by the smart politicking of tywin lannister and when tywin decided to switch sides that was when he truly lost even without a constitution monarchies will always be restricted by the conventions and wishes of those who keep them in power i really recommend watching cgp grey's rules for rulers it's linked up in the corner goes into a bit more of this part three communication control and commerce i talked about the importance of these three cs enrolling in a lot more detail in my videos on empires also linked up in the corner but they are relevant to all governing structures and to monarchs in some specific ways that we'll cover today communication is how quickly information can be relayed between the central authority and its provinces the more quick and detailed it is the more power a monarch has to rule the challenges of a pre-modern setting are obvious to address this some monarchs historically developed itinerant royal courts ones that moved throughout the country emperor henry vi traveled more than 4 000 kilometers in 1193 across germany this means that communication doesn't create so much of a barrier for ruling as they can place themselves wherever they are needed most the mongolian monarch established the or2 in the 1200s a system of 14 000 or more checkpoints with horses and shelter that allowed messengers to easily travel 20 to 30 miles a day across the vast kingdom in sannison's the way of kings the communication barrier is overcome through magic with the use of span reads which are a comparatively fast way of transmitting large amounts of information across great distances allowing a high level of direct control necessarily monarchs in modern or futuristic settings will not likely face these same challenges control is how easy it is for the monarch to exert influence over a particular region both in speed and level of force it's not quite as easy to just say i am your king in my videos on empires i define control as really asking why do people remain as part of the state this is another reason that some early monarchies held itinerant courts the early egyptian domestic court held the following of horus where they travelled about the country to not only be more visible to subjects but to help them exert influence directly over the lower class and the outer regions not just vicariously through the upper class empowering themselves and depowering those directly beneath them but monarchs have a characteristic way of maintaining control and we gotta talk about that the system of patronage this is basically what rewards and punishment the monarch gives not only to ensure loyalty to the crown but to maintain the power of the crown commercially these are giving or taking titles lands economic rights government positions or status in the royal court for example the qing dynasty granted the right to wear peacock feathers a complex and important symbol in chinese mythology and religion your system of patronage though will be closely tied to the economic and social systems of your world because european feudal power was largely based on land ownership the system of patronage was significantly tied to giving land to those who supported the monarch or taking it away elizabeth the first rewarded subjects with the loan of important lands but retained ownership to maintain the land power of the crown a futuristic society though may be basing the system of patronage on data ownership or technology rights as they grow in value and importance in this day i could imagine a monarch in an altered carbon type world where you live forever by putting your mind into a new body punishing people by removing their ability to do so taking away their discs at the heart of the system of patronage the world building question for you is what is valuable and what is punishing in your society while you can use the conventional stuff and that's totally okay consider finding something unique that sets your system a patronage apart as well just to give your monarchy a unique feel but to bring control and communication together the thing is historically monarchs dealt with communication issues and maintain control by making it so that they didn't have to they would promote people they trusted and demote people they didn't this way a they didn't need to maintain direct communication with all provinces to rule them all directly all the time and b they weren't worried about losing control because people they trusted were in power the strategy necessarily became a lot more difficult when democratic or constitutional norms arose but also when other power structures challenged them particularly religious ones the investiture controversy started a struggle between pope gregory vii and emperor henry vi in 1076 over who could appoint bishops which held considerable land and power the world building questions for you are a who does the monarch trust and not trust to maintain their power and b which democratic or constitutional norms or power structures make this strategy more difficult thus depowering the monarch or at least complicating the web of power around them lastly commerce see commerce is a crucial factor in the stability of a state monarchy or not and it's important to understand how your king interacts with the economy making it better or worse they tended to stop itinerant moving courts and create fixed capital cities as financial centers to the country developed though they usually resisted at first as it meant recognizing the power of a growing merchant class constantine moved the capital from rome to constantinople not only for security reasons but because rome was declining as an economic centre while constantinople now controlled the masses of black sea trade now there isn't that much to say about specific policies that monarchs employed that other systems of government didn't with the exception of three things mercantilism tanks and patronage mercantilism is an economic theory that's uh wrong it developed in the waning years of monarchical power and partly evolved as a method of indirectly retaining power eli heckscher an economic historian detailed that mercantilism revealed a fairly uniform conception of general social phenomena in the field of economics that all interests were to be made obedient to the monarch as the embodiment of the state it was a semi-planned economy that discouraged imports and maximized exports with the monarch largely determining what should be made sold and bought for supposedly the good of the country but really the good of them mercantilism did not work and is one of the hallmarks of waning monarchical power hurting commerce and actually eventually leading to market liberation that accompanied the depowering or even overthrow of monarchs throughout the 17th 18th and 19th centuries if your monarchy is declining in power then perhaps a good way to reflect this is with attempts at mercantilism secondly while who in water's text varies radically across history what does remain true is that monarchies tend to be well they're really petty in 1705 emperor peter the great of russia taxed beards because he wanted people to look more like western europe come on please we're just like you oliver cromwell texts the royalists his political enemies just just an extra 10 to piss them off the reason is that unitary powers like monarchs are more subject to personal whims there's not as much to stop them it's not uncommon for the crown to monopolize specific resources like gemstones or peacocks were in the han dynasty which go on to be symbols of prestige and power the question is if your monarch has powers of taxation what less rational ways might the tax system be set up thirdly monarchs would often grant economic boons as part of the system of patronage often in the form of monopolies and these were greatly sought after because they made you rich elizabeth the first temporarily improved the english economy by granting patent monopolies for new inventions which is similar to what we do today but monopolies soon became so unrestricted and so common that that there were harmful consequences that became a serious grievance under the harsh economic conditions of the 1590s for by the licences a few were enriched and the multitude impoverished fundamentally which economic rights are sought after and given will sharply reflect what is monetarily valuable in your society so don't just think of you know resources or whatever in frank herbert's dune this was the spice resource in particular which has a really unique role in the story in blade runner this was the production of androids the tyrell corporation as a monopoly on but the granting of monopolies can undermine the economy that is important to understand consider which say five major resources or products would be most in demand in your world and how the monarch uses economic patronage to interfere with their supply demand and cost part 4 the royal court if a monarch is influential in your story some kind of royal court will likely be an important setting where major characters interact and big story beats happen so it's important to be creative or get it right understand that royal courts are not just a european thing it's not just european traditions like you've seen in a game of thrones arabic asiatic european and even african royal courts worked vastly different to one another in the four ps praxis power structures positions and purposes praxis is just the word i'm using for traditions because i liked the idea of calling it the four ps the japanese imperial court had a tradition of saibara songs which came from songs sung by those transporting tribute to the kyoto capital in the past signifying the importance of this procession in their culture and history we might understand traditional titles like duke baron and mr tibbles maybe to be hereditary but in the qing dynasty titles were often downgraded with every generation placing emphasis on how far removed you were by bloodline from the person who earned it see traditions in royal courts that you know of come from historical realities which may not exist in your world so simply transplanting the 1577 french court into your book can be well unrealistic now when considering power structures there will be factions within the royal court vying for power the question is who will these be and what are their interests and this can be weird and wonderful in your fictional world coming from any number of societal economic religious or otherwise backgrounds not just wanting money or land take how the eunuchs were often an incredibly important class and the ottoman vietnamese and particularly chinese imperial courts where they would interfere with the line of succession and did even appoint themselves as regent rulers the janissaries the royal bodyguards of the ottoman empire had a massive and complex role to play i really suggest you go and read up about what they did and who they were likewise positions in the royal court usually reflect the power structures within the wider state as monarchs wish to keep powerful influences nearby in the wheel of time series by robert jordan the merlin seat is a powerful female mage such that all royal courts basically have a position for her advisers whose authority is almost never questioned her position and power reflects who wields power in the wider society and lastly let's talk about purpose the purpose of the royal court it may focus or at least lean on one or two areas the imperial chinese court of the ming dynasty focused on military and ceremonial matters because they had a complex bureaucracy to deal with the rest while the ottoman royal court placed emphasis on religious issues with important positions to denote this because of its theocratic tendencies or maybe your court stays away from religious issues like some european powers did when the church was incredibly powerful now these are generalizations but the interests of the royal court often lean into particular areas that arise from the society of the day and it'll be interesting to see how your royal court reflects that to build on this this will become more limited as in their focus will become more limited as it becomes more constitutional and they lose more power leading them to more ceremonial roles like part 5 how monarchies collapse eventually all heads roll including the monarch and especially if you're french see a monarchy is overthrown much the same way that any government is so i'm going to focus on where it's different to how other government structures collapse we tend to focus on how monarchy declines under the rise of democratic power because that's kind of the world we're in but this isn't necessarily the case in 1939 italy invaded and abolished the albanian monarchy but they were ruled by benito mussolini a fascist before then dozens of african monarchies were virtually wiped out during the colonial era and while this was by semi-democratic powers they were placed under a dictatorial rule and it was done primarily for economic gain not truly liberating them throughout the middle ages the church toppled dozens of petty kings and lords as their theocratic power rivaled their own point is monarchies are overthrown when it's advantageous for competing powers to do so it's not necessarily democratic or liberating by monarchies being elevated figures accustomed to wealth worship and symbolic importance often did fight against growing constitutional and democratic norms the norwegian king the british queen the danish king the swedish king the japanese emperor the tongan king thai king and many others were all those who adjusted to new constitutional demands and divested their powers those that didn't or didn't do it quick enough in the case of tsar nicholas got lined up against the wall for the most part no matter what period futuristic ancient modern or pre-modern your book is based in there will be tension between the monarch's powers and another group whoever that is for your society consider who has which powers which powers they will contest and where that relationship is heading getting worse getting better or on the brink of collapse if your story is about the collapse of a monarchy then this tension will likely be a long-term causal factor in why but more importantly here study how real world monarchies survived and failed it's so much more complex than i am able to get into and they will be a better resource than i could ever be but i want to talk about a world building trope that isn't so great see the collapse of a monarchy doesn't mean that the current monarch was specifically terrible king louis xvi of france was the monarch at the time of the french revolution but he actually attempted numerous reforms to be a little more democratic and transparent the problem was more with the nobility around him and being a symbolic figurehead of the aristocracy blame was put onto him and he was a figurehead no more not even a head anymore monarchies exist at the heart of complex systems and sometimes cannot truly control them nor stop them the collapse will happen regardless of what they do and a big part of the collapse of many monarchies is in tradition monkeys are big bloated elaborate systems that are very difficult to change and even though the economic cultural and social norms the power structures of the wider society may change that doesn't mean that the monarchy itself will actually reflect that for example let's take the world building of an elective monarchy the question of who elicks the monarch is an important question to ask and while we would expect this to be based on who is powerful in society who is powerful doesn't stay the same it changes though not only to monarchy take the house of lords in the uk it's made up of clergymen nobles and others who don't really have any power anymore not truly at least yet they are part of this elective representative body the point is that how the monarchy works may reflect how things were in the past but are not necessarily now as these kind of large structures take a lot more time to change than i think society often does a good example of this is that now many monarchies allow the eldest child to ascend to the throne regardless of whether they are a man or a woman but that change only happened once the women's rights movement had really been in full swing for a long time so when we're building your monarchy don't just ask how things work now in your society but ask how they worked in the past and how much of a dissonance there is between those two things and this is relevant to how monarchies collapse because i think that when there's a real dissonance between those two things between how the monarchy works and how society actually works how those powers are set up that it can lead to tension between those two sides to instability even if the monarch holds a lot of power and that really leads us on to part six a good kingdom a good king make not i am the king this is a really common world building pitfall there's a good quote from martin on tolkien's world building lord of the rings had a very medieval philosophy that if the king was a good man the land would prosper we look at history and it's not that simple what was aragorn's tax policy did he maintain a standing army what did he do in times of flood and famine if your kingdom is unstable then it's almost never simply just because he was a bad monarch and if your kingdom was prosperous it's almost never just because they were a good mark and certainly not because they were just moral if your kingdom is unstable then it's almost never just because they were a bad monarch and if your kingdom is prosperous it's almost never just because they were a good monarch certainly not because they were moral that's actually the point of daenerys storyline instead think of it in terms of environment economy and culture things largely outside the monarch's control natural forces like drought famine good harvest storms and long summers and short winters are major factors in the stability of a state regardless of how the monarch acts the zhao dynasty adopted the mandate of heaven which meant that disasters were an indication of the emperor losing favor of the gods and long periods of natural disaster sometimes lead to their overthrow likewise though monarchs can regulate they can't truly control the economy where a downturn would often lead to instability closely paired with famines and drought and culture that's a weird one though the queen can influence it culture is so complex that they can't really control how class race sex religion and traditions all interact all of which make for a state stable or unstable if you want to well build your kingdom to be prosperous or unprosperous come up with economic environmental and cultural reasons why outside the monarch's control for thy lord sozen for example he just happened to rule in a time full of inventors academics and good crop harvests it was a really successful time for the fire nation but how much was firelord sozan really responsible but before we go into the summary today's sponsor there are some who call me dashlane and the wizard is offering you a 30-day free trial

services separately so at least try it free go over to www.dashlane.com hellofutureme all the links are down below and in summary firstly you can have a successive or elected monarchy consider what equalizing factors or requirements for leadership would change succession or how the elected monarchy is prevented from becoming hereditary either can be constitutional the question is what are the interests of those who bind the monarch and which powers matter in your society secondly consider where the de jure and the de facto power lies in your society by asking who controls the wealth the resources people and social capital building on this absolute monarchies are never truly absolute and are always kept in power by those around them figure out who those are thirdly consider how communication and control challenges are overcome by your monarch as well as how other powers or constitutional norms make this difficult consider how attacks patronage and possibly mercantilism stabilize or destabilize the economy of the state fourthly in we're building a unique royal court consider drawing from asiatic arabic african or other less familiar models to set yours apart a good method to build around is finding unique traditions unique core positions and titles unique factions vying for power and a particular focus while other issues are otherwise handled fifthly monarchies don't just collapse because the monarch was terrible nor does the decline of their power come from necessarily democratic influence consider the nature of this tension between monarchical powers and the powers of the rest of society who wants what and why also the way your monarchy works does not necessarily reflect the way your society works now and secondly monarchies don't prosper and suffer merely because of a good king or a bad king factors in the environment economy and culture likely contribute more so despite being outside the modest control for the most part and that's all we've got for monarchies if you're wondering where all the little references throughout the video come from it comes from multi python and the holy grail it's a fantastic film classic comedy i do really

therapy of a kind for her as she drove the decisions in Morgan's story the narrative helping her come to term with her mistakes accept herself and move forward in time that's it date passed her plan was no longer needed video games differ from books TV shows and films through one major force agency the interactive nature of the medium allows us to engage with the text to ideas on a different level players don't just passively experience the story characters and themes but actively participate in their creation progression and conclusion and while it's good the player agency means that games have a lot of potential to help those who are struggling there is also a lot of risk and introducing agency to exploring mental health and that makes things complicated the YouTube algorithm doesn't not like videos like this and sponsors just do not feel appropriate for it at all this is why only my patrons independent support makes it possible for me to research take time for consult on and create videos like this any support at the link below immensely appreciated part one just breathe you can do this in a 2015 Poland University study Sheena ramela highlighted two unique opportunities that video games represent for mental health therapeutic game playing which provides players with therapy if they are struggling themselves and informative game playing through which players can vicariously learn and understand the trials that people with mental illness go through in 2018 extremely ok games released Celeste a 2d platformer about a girl called Medellin struggling with anxiety and depression humbly described on its reddit as a video game about climbing a mountain about halfway through the story she has a panic attack and the player has to try and control her breathing by helping a feather float calmly up and down in time with her slowing breath as the player brings her breathing under control the visuals of the game come but if the player stops focusing then it becomes erratic again Sheena Miller describes therapeutic game playing in four steps first the designer researchers treatment methods second the designer incorporates them into the game thirdly the plan navigates the game world and fourthly consciously or unconsciously they receive treatment writer mad for sense certainly researched or had used a very real anxiety attack coping strategy and incorporated it and DISA lists a player navigating it's beautiful 2d world would learn this strategy and though the game was not intended as therapy they do receive a kind of therapy but understanding the role of agency here is more crucial numerous studies have shown that active learning being a hands-on and personally involved with a decree of agency and B having the ability to succeed and fail is a far more efficient way of learning than passive learning listening watching or reading the agency given to players navigating the game world and mechanics is a form of active learning fundamentally games are about teaching people to get better at mechanics hence why the difficulty tends to escalate in a game and this is all reinforced by 2016 study on games as learning methods that found that students in the game-playing intervention group were more likely to show a positive score change than the control group students with improved communication scores adaptability and resourcefulness now there they were teaching children graduate skills but it's clear from this quality that video games are a potentially more effective avenue of therapy than other fiction forms teaching people coping strategies and helping them deal with their mental health struggles in celeste the player is involved with active therapeutic game learning in the panic attack scene learning the feather mechanic while also learning the coping mechanism themselves and part of this comes down to a difference in perspective TV shows books and films typically make the reader or viewer an outsider to the person with the mental health struggles we are observing the story of someone else whereas games are much closer to a first-person experience where agency makes the characters actions your actions especially because planned characters and games are often designed to allow us to project ourselves onto them even sometimes to the point of personal character creation even in first-person book narratives using AI it still feels like we are being told the story but the agency here means that the panic of the Medellin fields is much more your panic and the coping strategy much more your skill when you learn it because of this it will stick with you more effectively than simply being told about it the agency element of games also means that when mechanics like this are taught they taught at the pace that the player needs to learn them they're allowed to try and to fail to exact their skill a vital part of internalizing this mental health coping mechanism this is markedly different to books and visual media which don't allow that they go at the pace the author or the director dictated it should go and their feet in this here is well proven a 2016 study found games assisted with general anxiety as a hands-on exercise it helped prevent people from for example skin picking or nail biting likewise a 2007 study found the social element of world Warcraft helped with social anxiety the simulated world allowed people to speak and act more freely when they otherwise would not feel comfortable but the role of player agency in therapeutic game learning has a downside the recent twenty20 game the suicide of Rachel Foster explores the story of well Rachel Foster and what eventually led to her supposed suicide but what really matters here is that after a sickening realization the player is forced into a position where the player character is considering killing herself the player is forced to actively go through the steps of preparing for her ultimate suicide the details of which we will not go into here in other media forms though you may understand a character's motivation to suicide there's a visual and psychological distance between you and them but you are not watching someone else here as before player agency means that these actions feel like your own these hands feel like yours and that can be markedly dangerous for someone in a bad headspace not only teaching them a way to kill themselves by putting a practiced plan into their head you often hear that you shouldn't report on how people into their lives and part of why this is is they're the three greatest indicators of risk our plan means and time frame how they would do it whether they have access to the things required to do it and when they would do it placing players in a position where they actively engage with following through on a suicide is an incredibly risky thing for that subset of people a 2015 study found video games that simulate death and violence to oneself and others make them fear death less and less sensitive to pain increased acquired capability allows individuals to overcome the fear and pain that would usually inhibit a suicide attempt games that simulate self-harm and suicide not only heighten the chance of them finding a plan by giving them a concrete idea and letting them see it play out from their perspective like a rehearsal but player agency here undoes those inhibitions in a way that we haven't found other fiction forms do and to make it worse games like the sewers Rachel Foster often use a soft fade as they die making it seem peaceful and relieving which just isn't true it's a horrible way to go from this just as player agency can be an effective framework for therapy and empathy it can also become a dangerous motivator and enabler part 2 nobody cares about me opening in downloads 2015 game life is strange the player intervenes to save Kate Marsh from taking her own life if you've paid attention to her throughout the game her life and how she thinks then you'll be able to stop her if you haven't know then she dies for much the same reason as Celeste this was pretty personally cathartic for me as someone who has been in similar situations to max here saving Kate wasn't just narrative lis satisfying but personally validating especially when I've been unable to stop people close to me attempting in the past but this raises the question what if you don't save her there is a myth about mental health mental health is often treated as a single person centric problem that one person is struggling and it's about them but this isn't true it's really hard to be the support especially the only support for someone struggling with depression self-harm suicide or other issues which is the position that the player finds themself in as max Caulfield to examine why agency becomes a problem here though we have to understand something called the locus of control the degree to which someone believes that their life is inside their control internal or outside their control external numerous studies have shown that the ability to develop a locus that understands which things are outside your control and which things are inside your control is key to handling stress and trauma now books in visual fiction like John Green's Turtles all the way down reinforce that external locus of control we aren't responsible for the characters what falls them or how they deal with it but in video games player agency means that we not only feel responsible for characters like Kade taking their own life but we are the only variable in the game that could have ever saved them there was no option where Kate stepped back from the ledge herself nor one where another character intervened feelings of guilt responsibility if only I said this or did that are really hard to deal with for the people surrounding those suffering I would know and it's okay to acknowledge that but we have to be careful about what we're saying is the players fault because allowing player agency to reinforce those negative thoughts of guilt isn't the healthiest but the question remains then how do we handle this I don't think that life estrange has necessarily bad representation here I talked in my first video extensively about how fiction impacts those who suffer and those who don't very differently and that those are two different problems though that was my experience someone else may find that being the only person who could save Kate is a motivating force to help others in real life because they feel more responsible now and that's a healthy thing but fundamentally this is where it being a good informative game that helps non mentally ill people empathize comes into conflict with it being a good therapeutic game and it's not necessarily something that we can resolve other than to perhaps make it clearer who the game is made for we tend to try and come up with single formulas or a totalizing theory about how to do mental illness right whatever that means but I'm not sure that's possible instead when it comes to narratives that deal with mental health we have to ask what does the role of player agency tell the player they are responsible for we might not be responsible for Kate's death but we are responsible for whether we paid attention and reached out when we saw her struggling part three let go of talion battle with the exception of games like what remains of Edith Finch videogames they usually structured around players mastering game mechanics and overcoming obstacles often with violence and this leads to the unfortunate intersection of mental illness stigma and violent gameplay the number one damaging math about mental illness is that they are inherently violent I don't have a problem with the combat which I see and its demands for complex manual skills as a part of the gamers enjoyment but presenting in character why the lives in a constant cycle a break where she perceives people as demons and lops off the hills with a giant sword is not helpful the fact remains that they are suggesting that mentally ill people do not see reality and a tank violently not only a mentally ill people ten times more likely to be the victims of violence than the perpetrators with only four percent of violent acts attributed to those living with the mental illness but the nature of player engagement and agency often means their mental illness is either tied to the justification for violence in a game think vast Montenegro from Far Cry 3 whose main justification for becoming a violent obstacle for the player to overcome is madness or it's used as a way to alter violent gameplay in video games think Alice the Menace Returns where manifestations of mental illness are used to create unique enemies this runs into the good game problem similar to the good story problem I talked about in that first video that sometimes good gameplay can be at odds with a good informative game we're simply more likely to engage with games that portray mental illness in a certain way and not necessarily good we may just enjoy games that use mental illness to spice up the combat now while we should dismantle the idea of this group being violent the mere fact that there is stigma around it doesn't mean that we shouldn't explore the connection between mental illness and violence which is a mistake I think a lot of critics make in a vice documentary about the Filipino child sick straight they talked about how emotional release therapy is one of releasing all the negative emotions of the children and this includes you violence in a safe space and games allow for exactly that kind of thing video game violence like inhale blades to know a sacrifice can be incredibly cathartic for people struggling meaning violence can be a foundational part of a therapeutic game without reinforcing that negative stigma hell-blade uses fantastical violence as a lens to explore sin who is frustrated place her anger with herself and her anger with the world constantly seeming at war with her own mind and those trying to put her down around her but as Traci Conkle puts it the story of Hell bleed is much more one of a person whose problems have arisen from violence done to her and who is herself far from violent the emotional experience of the story is one of deep empathy using the saddening violence as a lens to which we can understand the pressures on her and what feels like a constant fight and everything she does the deeper question is not merely whether it associates mental illness with violence but whether the game uses violence in a way that inspires empathy for the character rather than demonization which is what you'll find in a hell of a lot of horror games like amnesia the Dark Descent and outlast that sprinklin a little mental illness to make the game play scarier and give us justification for violence without ever asking us to imbecile their mental state more deeply and to avoid reinforcing that negative stigma some games employee an entirely different model of player engagement and game mechanics when dealing with mental illness Marc Brown over at game makers toolkit discussed games like Deus Ex and life is strange the game doesn't tell you which dialogue option will work you have to decide for yourself by reading their mood their reaction to your previous dialogue choices and other social cues all these games test your emotional and social skills just like how puzzle games test your logic skills we can make dialog trees that aren't just basic skill chicks that let you skip through gameplay but are involved negotiations that become involving gameplay in and of themselves downs here describes game mechanics that rely less on violence reaction time strategy and build optimization and instead focus on social and emotional skills like you have to use in fire watch and actual sunlight and this isn't just using game mechanics as an analog for developing coping mechanisms and empathy for others like in Grist but actually using directly translatable skills in game play life is strange acts as an informative game that teaches players to look for signs and others and how they talk and how they act that might indicate suicidal ideation for example phrases like but she's been extra quiet and introverted the past couple weeks she looks like she's in zombie mode that would be every fly to me at the helpline but it wouldn't necessarily be to others but this model also helps with developing therapeutic games for example allowing people with anxiety to play through difficult social interactions in a safe environment an experience that is incredibly helpful and therapeutic violence can be a healthy part of either an informative game or a therapeutic game for mental illness but inventing other models of player engagement and game mechanics can also be really valuable and I think it's really important that we look for when these two different styles are more appropriate part four one last thing a shadow is following you in frictional games 2010 and me Jie the Dark Descent players have to manage a sanity meter as it goes down the player will experience hallucinations and delusions with changes to their vision hearing fake screams and altering what they know to be real or not this is intended to reflect the very real dsm-5 symptoms of schizophrenia and the game is heavily designed around your ability to master this game mechanic it's basically what lets you survive learning and using strategies to keep your sanity high similar mechanics that the player can learn and control are used in other games games are after all designed around players mastering predictable game mechanics and overcoming obstacles players have to do something that's what makes them fun now obviously amnesia is depiction of schizophrenia here is reductionist and incredibly inaccurate but I don't think that that criticism alone gets to the heart of the issue here exclude mental illness from representation in game mechanics simply because they in some way simplify them nope for example ingress as the player character overcomes her depression and grief she gradually attains abilities that allow her to move more freely a simplified idea of how rising out of depression is psychologically liberating yes but not harmful representation it's more problem for games that use a resource management mechanic designed around you managing your mental health issues for example keeping your anxiety self-harm urges hallucinations or otherwise in chick see mental illness isn't something that can be gamed easily predicted or controlled to a tee like a game mechanic unlike many visible illnesses pills and self-care strategies that may work for one person won't work for the next and recovery is often a long inconsistent road of relapses it is not a mechanic you can master so when it comes to designing an informative game aimed at helping non mentally ill people empathize seeing mental illness doesn't work like many visible illnesses isn't just one part of a mental illness that we can sort of simplify but fundamental to understanding what it's like to live with it on a very base level the truth is we too often hear the stigmatizing messages if all you need is some fresh air just take your pills they help they're good but treating them like some kind of cure is just entirely misinformed and really alienating so let's compare amnesia and Celeste we talked before about that further meccanica that the player is taught to use and rely on as a method of explicitly managing your panic attacks the game Falls you into thinking you can always overcome your anxiety by getting really good at using the feather mechanic but later on in the game writer Matt Thorson goes the extra step here with his manage your anxiety mechanic during a tense confrontation a panic attack hits you but when you try to use the floating feather mechanic it doesn't work the feather breaks anxiety isn't something that can be gamed here and we feel the same loss of control all the Medellin does subverting player agency and really helping its role as an informative game 2013 game depression quiz does a similar thing where the character is sometimes simply unable to do things because of their depression fundamentally when it comes to games that have a mechanic requiring you to manage your mental health subvert in player agency is necessary to an extent to make it an informed experience and this is markedly different to games like life is strained we're acknowledging someone takes anti-anxiety medication is just part of narrative and you can incorporate this idea relatively easily rather than as a game mechanic that the player will try to master and unfortunately this does once again intersect with the good game problem that the best gaming experience does not necessarily make for the best informative game despite being perhaps a more authentic experience the player being unable to rely on certain game mechanics to work consistently can lead to a frustrating feeling of pointlessly stunted game progression this is actually the point of depression quest to make you feel that frustration and it works one way to deal with this in game design is to make it inevitable like the writers did for the ending of hell-blade where players have to realize that continuing to fight like they did before will not beat this obstacle player agency as subvert it as they have to choose to stop fighting something they were conditioned against the entire game much like Sinnoh has to realize that she needs to stop fighting the feeling of loss and instead confronted a powerful and difficult thematic realization for player and character or alternatively like in celeste use the subversion of player agency to not just stall the gameplay and set the player back but let that failure lead on to new and different obstacles creating very gameplay that still accounts for this uncomfortable reality part five I still thought I could save him even after he said he was being crowned king over all the lands of wonder in giant sparrows what remains of Edith Finch you explore the story of Lois and it's one of the most horrifying and touching gaming experiences I have ever had the player is put into Lewis's character working at a cannery the mechanics involved moving a fish from one side of the screen to the other cutting off the head and pushing them forward with just your mouse the player does this over and over and over again for nearly ten minutes straight as you do so though an imaginative adventure story begins to take over the screen like Lois your mind becomes focused on that imaginative more interesting world while you absent-mindedly continue your job eventually though when it takes over the entire screen it leads to the metaphorical suicide of Lois Finch what I want to focus on here is realism critics of mental health representation often focus on a very particular kind of realism focusing on things like the exact drugs a character takes the escalation of their harmful urges what they are like in their day to day life and realistic patterns of relapse and rehabilitation and thus stories that don't reflect those sorts of things get criticized but I don't think that we should criticize purely based on thing unrealistic equals thing bad accuracy does matter but I think that this critique is not only pointlessly reductionist but it misses the value power and proper role of fiction in the first place videogames are a fictional way to explore real things and that's their strength not a weakness I talked briefly before about how the metaphorical mechanics and art style of Gris beautifully captures the feeling of depression and grief even if they're not grounded in this specific kind of realism likewise what remains of Edith Finch doesn't really do any of these stereotypically realistic things either this is not what suicide depression or hallucinations usually look like at all but perhaps more than any other game what remains of Edith Finch more empathetically captures what suicidal ideation feels like it doesn't just tell us how bad life was for Louis in fact we don't know much about his life outside the cannery but the player is forced to participate in this monotonous suffocating environment for 10 minutes straight player agency is used to make us feel the way that Louis does in the way that only a videogame can everything is created to confront you with the claustrophobic stretches of real life you and Lewis are trapped in this eerily dungeon-like room in the focuses never on wanting death instead Louis and the player just end up wanting a way out a crucial distinction for suicidal individuals that a lot of people just don't seem to understand this hell really does feel inescapable and marching towards the light feels like a triumph with an orchestra cheering you on all of this is what makes what remains of Edith Finch a fantastic example of Miller's informative game giving the player and authentic emotional experience of that psychological state of suicidal ideation without even focusing on that particular kind of realism Lewis never even speaks a single word to put it simply and discussing hell-blade another game that uses a fictional analog to explore Schism affective disorders Aaron supports rights although at its heart hell-blade is a third-person fantasy combat game it's striving for realism in the areas that matter that someone might be offered an opportunity to guide a character suffering these experiences and gain an understanding and empathy and that's the difference as I said before you thie necessarily some unrealism will result in a misinformed empathy but that's empathy nonetheless and I do think that representation is just as much about changing attitudes towards one another as it is about accurately understanding one another too different sometimes at odds but both very valuable aims after all claims of realism still often exclude some certain fringe but real experiences that would undermine those feelings of empathy I think it's just important to remember that video games are ultimately an art form and that art is powerful so where does this leave us my focus in this video has been first and foremost on empathy and I think that's because I find fiction to be the closest thing we have to experiencing the reality of someone else when we're all trapped inside these hard skulls of house and for some people these skulls feel like prisons and maybe just maybe video games might let us reach out just a little bit further and for others it might make that prison just a little less claustrophobic if we lived forever maybe we'd have time to understand things but as it is I think the best we can do is try to open our eyes appreciate how strange and brief all of this is I want you to be amazed that any of us ever had a chance to be here at all this is where your story begins [Music] you [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] [Music] you\n",
      "SQCb7GiNOrE\n",
      "it's no secret that fight scenes are hard to write you could almost say fight scenes are complicated [Music] there are kind of two dimensions to writing fight scenes the macro broader things like structure and overall place in the narrative and the micro the sentence by sentence or word by word writing of a fight scene in a book and it's this part that doesn't get nearly enough attention there's already a lot of content out there about the macro of a fight scene because the same rules apply in tv and film so we'll be examining the micro of fight scenes from these 13 books to understand how to write a good fight scene on that level however the macro is still really important to understand and best-selling author of the shadowshaper series daniel jose older's skillshare class on writing standout opening scenes is a good place to start after all it's not uncommon to start stories with some kind of fight scene and his discussion of the microcosm of a scene character action and driving questions is a great framework regardless so consider it complimentary to today's video and you can watch it entirely for free for two months over on today's sponsor skillshare all at the links down below let's get down to business long or short sentences so the first piece of advice you'll be given when you look into writing fight scenes is write shorter sentences and i want you to know that little secret come in close this is bull crap let me spill the tea it is true that some stories do use shorter sentences to better reflect the quick back and forth of a fight scene lee child writes the jack redirection stories and uses short sentences to never let a moment linger these aren't even complete sentences like tightened his finger which lacks the grammatical subject he as if complete thoughts aren't possible in a tense moment like a fight if quang employs a similar technique in the poppy war where shorter sentences reflect the brutal and sharp movements of martial arts these shorter sentences are usually focused on a strong verb without many adjectives or other framing he struck her face once twice thrice but not only do these fight scenes have a lot of long sentences as well but the majority of fight scenes don't shorten their sentences enough for you to take this as some kind of clear and applicable advice or rule and that's because it's less about sentence length and more about how the individual fight beats are short consider the sentence in blake crouch's dark matter i slam into the hardwood floor the back of my head hitting so hard i see bursts of light and then he's on top of me blood dripping off his ruined face one hand squeezing my throat here there are four distinct beats that happen in quick succession slam hitting is on top of squeezing there are far more verb beats than in your average sentence which usually only have one or two and that each of these are really short gives the feeling of it being fast paced of high tension and placing these actions in the same sentence makes it feel faster because there's no full stop between them breaking these actions up like there's barely a moment to breathe and compare this with rowling's writing in the order of the phoenix dumbledore brandished his wand in one long fluid movement the snake which had been an instant from sinking its fangs into him flew high into the air and vanished in a wisp of dark smoke the water in the pool rose up and covered voldemort like a cocoon of molten glass once again speed and tension isn't about sentence length it's about action beats taking as little time as possible brandishing sinking flu vanish to rose and covered a hell of a lot happens in a single sentence here each beat just a handful of words so let your sentences be short or long but make each action beat very short using a chain of strong verbs that allow the reader to follow the fight beats as fast as they would take to happen for example this scene in the film actually takes just a little bit longer to happen than it does to read aloud part 2 cause and effect having a series of verbs in quick succession does not an interesting fight make saying marwyn kicked his opponent then thrust his fist into a punch dodging left and cutting up with his elbow into his enemy's jaw is a sentence of quick verb succession but it is a not interesting or b easy to follow this is because there is no strong relationship of cause and effect between these verbs what you'll notice is that whether using short or long sentences good fight scene writing also has a strong feeling of cause and effect moving from one verb to the other take this passage and james essay corey's leviathan wakes holden shook violently in his restraints and then slapped back into his chair as alex took the rocky through a series of sudden maneuvers and then slammed down the throttle to evade the last of the pdc fire shook slapped slammed and evade each of these four quick succession verbs don't just follow one another but they have a strong relationship of causing each other holden shakes and slaps back into his chair because they are accelerating and evading this makes it a lot easier to follow for the reader because it gives the fight scene a sense of chronology on a sentence by sentence basis in contrast with this kicked thrust dodge and cut the sentence lacks any strong feeling of causation making each movement feel ultimately pointless in its own way you could take one out or put them in any order and it wouldn't really make a difference would it so look for where those sentences are in your work but in framing your cause and effect verb chains there are particular sentence patterns that i've noticed a lot of writers use a common one being react pause act consider this fight scene in martin's a game of thrones and it must be said of sir vardis egan that he was true to his lady's command even to the last one moment he was reeling backward half crouched behind his scarred shield the next he charged the sudden bull rush caught bronn off balance it's all centered around that second sentence react reeling pause crouched act charged likewise in sanderson's skyward when spencer is being chased through the air by the enemy i cut my clivity ring spun on my axis then over burned right back downward react cut pause spun act overburned these patterns maintain that sense of cause and effect and chronology while also giving a variety of pacing to the fight scene the react pause act framework means the character isn't repetitively doing the same thing in different words kicked punched thrust and so on they're changing tactics considering surroundings and being active a second verb pattern includes goal conflict disaster grabbing his head i bring my knee back for another blow but he sweeps my left leg out from under me goal grabbing conflict bring and disaster sweep it's a simple fast-paced sentence model that serves a different purpose here react pau's act sentences give a sense of moving towards the goal while the goal conflict disaster feels like it's moving away from the character's goal meaning you can use these pretty effectively together to give a real rhythm to the fight scene though not in a single sentence this scene from sanderson skyward follows these two patterns put together i got enclosed and speared the krell ship with my light lines then i turned pulling the krell ship out of line with bog the cockpit trembled around me sending us both into a frantic out of control spin goal conflict disaster then i cut my cleverly ring spun on my axis then over burned right back downward react pause act they work together really well but don't think of these as rigid rules but what they are patterns and suggestions be creative with your sentence length the number of verb segments you have and remember that the cause effect relationship is really what's most important to clarity and rhythm in other words fight scenes are complicated [Music] even so you've got to admit that this does have a nice flow to read path 3 where should you give detail while using the cause of fate structure and those verb patterns will help those alone don't make the fight well paced you don't need to describe every moment of the fight in equal detail no i offer that there are three main types of moments where the fight is described in their close detail like we've been discussing the first is when there is a shift in the balance of power consider this fight in al-makatsu's the hunger before stanton could pull his gun from its holster the man tackled him knocking him to the ground the whirling sand obscured details and made stanton feel as though he were wrestling a faceless phantasm one however who reeked of whiskey stanton managed to jerk aside when the man plunged a fist toward his face and heard a knife blade strike loose sand beside him they rolled over and over in the sand scrabbling for advantage fighting not just each other but the wind a giant hand hurling them through the dark he caught the man good in the ribs though and heard him cry out and then stanton was sure he recognized the voice lewis keysberg there are three distinctly described moments in this fight here in the first it's the inciting incident of the fight that shifts the balance of power against stanton in the second a knife is introduced raising the stakes and shifting the balance further and finally in the third stanton retakes power and learns the identity of his attacker all of these shift that balance of power but the more important phrase here is they rolled over and over in the sand scrabbling for advantage here nothing specific is described but the reader still gets the idea of what is happening two men wrestling over a knife in the dirt why though the reason nothing is described here is that there is no shift in the balance of power however some fight scenes are not actually based around struggles and power but non-combat goals like how in the girl with the dragon tattoo selenda is trying to free blonkfist at the same time as she is fighting instead of shifts and power it's the moments where she gets closer or further away from that goal that are described in that close detail because that's where the tension is drawn from in the scene this is particularly common in the horror genre where it's very common that one character is wholly overpowering the other who is just trying to escape or grab a weapon that non-combat goal so keep in mind the genre and what your characters are actually trying to do the second type of moment where authors add that close detail is in moments of character importance let's take a look at irf kwang's the poppy war the next time nisha lunged at her she pulled him to the floor with her they rolled around in the dirt each attempting to pin the other and failing he punched madly in the air flinging blows haphazardly at her face she dodged the first one he swung his fist back in reverse and caught her with a backhand that left her gasping the lower half of her face went numb he'd slapped her he'd slapped her a kick she could take a knife hand strike she could absorb but that slap had a savage intimacy like with el makatsu's the hunger the moments of the fight where there is no major shift in power are generalized with they rolled around in the dirt each attempting to pin the other and failing but detail is especially given to this moment where he slaps her see wren grew up socially isolated and repeatedly beaten down making the slight personally humiliating degrading and it changes how she fights from then on and lastly the third type of moment you might linger for is narrative importance things that you really want the character or the reader to reflect on take this final duel between harry potter and voldemort in the deathly hallows this single moment is described in lengthy detail to really allow the reader to linger on it and feel the tension and cathartic release more specifically it's purposeful but what about the other moments that don't have these things that we generalize well let's return to them renowned fantasy author brandon sanderson discusses fight scenes in saying you are not writing a screenplay if you describe a below by blow fight scene in a book no matter how well you describe it it's going to be boring play to the strengths of the novel medium arguably the greatest strength of a novel is the reader's imagination that is why generalized descriptions like they tussled on the ground for half a minute work the reader will likely better imagine it than you but there are two things that you can do to give them the tools to best do that sebastian de castel author of traders blade writes show the reader early on in the fight how each weapon moves through space make them vivid and visceral then you're free to focus on the character's actions and reactions this helps establish the feel and flow of the fight right at the start one example of this is in martin's a storm of swords with the deal between the viper and the mountain oberyn's long spear jabbed but sir gregor took the point on his shield shoved it aside and bowled back at the prince his great sword flashing the dornishmen spun away untouched this opening phrase establishes oberon as quick and darting and so grigor as an immovable figure with slow but brutal swings it's because of this opening to the fight that more generalized statements like this work later on show the way the people and weapons move and how the environment changes early on and allow the reader to do the rest of the work secondly these generalized statements are also where more creative language is used like this they wrestled in the dust and blood the mountain had wrapped one huge arm around the prince drawing him tight against his chest like a lover this is instead of those verb patterns and chronology that we've been emphasizing and it's because it's about creating a feeling for the fight not high-paced clarity so if you're looking for where to show off your unmatched metaphorical writing it's here and these generalized moments are important because verb after verb after verb with no creative imagery is still boring part four making it easy to follow more than usual scenes fight scenes rely on the reader's understanding of space where characters are what's around them and their physical options for movement science fiction writer rob wells summarized this in saying one of the biggest mistakes is we forget we are not a visual medium we don't know what the room looks like we don't know where the chairs are so when a character picks one up to fight with it it can come out of nowhere you need to set us up with the setting and when talking about space we really need to talk about jk rowling and the department of mysteries in the order of the phoenix seriously so first rowling establishes the space before the fight even begins giving the reader a clear idea of how to visualize the fight when it happens some authors fall into the trap of describing the space during the fight slowing the pacing immensely and making it seem a little bit convenient half the time but instead rolling right so that every spatial element that returns during the fight is set up prior he saw clocks gleaming from every surface large and small hanging in spaces between the bookcases or standing on desks ranging the length of the room and she returns to these special things when she writes a jet of red light hit the nearest death eater he fell backwards into a grandfather clock hermione had crawled under the desk to get a bit of rain both the fragile clocks and the desks mentioned in that first description return in the fight scene as complicating factors making it more interesting and keeping it easy to visualize by using these pre-established set pieces and she does this over and over again in a really skillful way all of this means that rowling can focus on character and emotions during the fight because none of her words are wasted on description see the use of space in a fight scene is a lot like a series of chekhov's guns if you tell the reader that there's a cliff nearby there's an inherent fear and expectation that someone's gonna fall a fight is only as good as its build up and introducing those spatial elements beforehand creates an expectation and tension for the readers and characters fundamentally if your environment is going to affect the way in which they fight then establishing those elements beforehand is crucial and will make the fight itself better because of this a really useful tool for planning fight scenes is blocking it's a theater term describing mapping out the movements of characters on a stage in broad strokes prior to details consider doing this for your fight scenes but space plays another important role in rowling's writing how do you manage fights with a host of characters when writing from a limited perspective cyres death is the single most important beat in this fight scene but it's written from the perspective of a single character harry yet it's rolling use of space that means the story naturally builds to this and makes it incredibly easy to follow in the chaos of numerous characters even if it's just from harry's perspective she regularly reminds the reader where characters are in particular reminding us where sirius is four times before his death moving down the steps 10 feet from harry on the dice with bellatrix then through the archway the other characters we don't physically follow nearly as closely but we don't need to we still get references to what they're doing during the fight so it feels like they're involved but rowling only carefully tracks the spatial journey of characters who play crucial roles harry malfoy bellatrix and sirius because of this sirius's death atop the dice does not take us by surprise that's where we expect him to be and it makes it incredibly easy to visualize even if you're writing from a single perspective give regular reminders to the reader where characters who play crucial roles in the fight scene story beats are that spatial knowledge really helps with visualization part five so sentence structure and pacing are one thing but word choice that's really where you get to craft the tone and feel of your fight scene how you describe pain and consequence to every blow consider how in king's horror novel the shining he repeatedly attaches visceral bodily descriptors to the fight the mallet came down again with whistling deadly velocity and buried itself in her soft stomach agony exploded on her right side as the mallet took her just below the line of her breasts breaking two ribs the mallet came down and landed just below her kneecap she jerked her head away from it and it scraped the flesh from her ear the dark swedish noir which is just to say swedish noir the girl with the dragon tattoo employs a similar technique the iron hit martin on the collar bone near his shoulder the blow had a terrible force and blanqvis heard something snap both authors deliberately use specific bodily descriptors to remind to the reader how fragile we are making it feel gritty brutal uncomfortable and bloody there is also a lot more emphasis on avoiding blows because every blow lands with serious consequence let's contrast this with some more light-hearted fiction in robert jordan's the wheel of time series without the void he was always half a heartbeat behind the tip of turok's heavy sword made a stinging trench just under his left eye a flap of coat sleeve hung away from his shoulder the darker for being wet the river undercuts the bank he dropped to one knee blades slashing across the descriptor is here for pain and consequence are far more generalized compared to larsen and king though characters are hit it's not usually devastating and the focus isn't nearly as much on avoidance this is a tonal choice that makes it less gritty more interested in spectacle which is why the prose doesn't linger on consequences in a fight too much this is a technique employed by fiction aimed at younger audiences as well and that's okay it's a stylistic choice but if you want that grittier fight then give those more specific visceral bodily descriptors to the harm done and focus on evasion the more generalized the verbs and adjectives the less gritty the fight will be for the reader you'll also notice that authors choose to use a wide variety of verbs and fight scenes more so than usual you don't use a different verb for speaking every time someone says something but not only are different verbs what give the impression of a varied and interesting fight in these very physical scenes but as daniel jose alda asks in the skillshare class i referenced at the beginning what are the verbs that we use whatever actions their character is doing do need to be things that tell us something about who that person is verb choice is often where we find character in fight scenes part six playing to the strengths of the novel medium hey hey yeah hey you know that you know that marvel film yeah where uh the guy gets powers and then he has to fight someone he has a personal relationship with yeah that was cool oh yeah real cool we should we should do that yeah we should do that definitely no a great book fight scene has different strengths we discussed before using the reader's imagination but another tool is the subjective experience of the character see books have the ability to get inside the head of characters far more than visual mediums do they have quirks like i see the word redrum everywhere oh there it is consider this knife fight in frank herbert's dune nearly 50 of it takes place inside paul's head weighing risks and contextualizing every move to his character journey and you'll find the same in a lot of other stories it's the difference between standards and writing my hand hovered as it reached for the eject labor between my legs i would not eject i was no coward i was not afraid to die and what will it do to them something within me asked if you do screaming i grabbed the eject lever and yanked hard and him just writing my hand hovered as it reached the eject level between my legs screaming i grabbed the lever and yanked hard the latter feels more like watching a fight scene through a camera in a visual medium while the former is soaked in the visceral subjective experience of spencer the latter is still good writing it's just lacking depth so use the subjective experience of your characters to frame and give depth to the action but the real question is how do you balance this how do you balance internalization and action it is hard and we've got a lot to talk about see internal monologue during a fight is not usually just characters observing things and thinking about things when it is it's kind of boring that doesn't give us the depth that we're really looking for stephen king only pauses the fight for wendy to internalize that her husband is truly going to kill her that this is life or death blake crouch in dark matter only pauses the fight to internalize the realization that he is about to die rowling only pauses the fight in the order of the phoenix so that harry can internalize sirius's death internalization usually explores why this fight matters each of these give emotional weight to the action immediately happening making the action itself more compelling very little internalization is emotionally neutral or lacking that emotive language so if your characters are just internalizing observing things it's probably not that interesting for the reader the challenge here is show don't tell it's an old axiom you've heard it before and it really leads into the second strength of the novel medium the five senses we usually focus on sight and sound because that's what visual mediums do but book fights use all five senses to help immerse their readers that fight in the hunger brings up how he reeked of whiskey and the sensation of swallowing a pound of grit this gives a different kind of realism to book fight scenes than to the tv or film mediums consider this passage from the girl with the dragon tattoo he was about to pass out and the pain in his temples was almost unbearable she turned to him and saw that his face was the color of a tomato his eyes were opened wide and his tongue was popping out of his mouth she stood on her toes and frantically sawed at the leather strap to get the noose off now larson could have internalized this in saying he knew he was near death and she knew she desperately had to free him and this kind of internalization would tell the reader why this fight matters but instead larson turns those thoughts into physical movements using sight and sensation the five senses to capture that feeling of panic and desperation instead of telling the reader why it matters with this kind of internalization he instead shows them through the physical experiences behind that idea fundamentally physicalize feelings with all five senses where you can and reserve internalization for those important story beats during the fight scene part 7. so you've got a better idea on how to balance internalization and action but what about balancing it with that sweet sweet dialogue almost every single one of these fights that we've looked at today has some amount of dialogue involved but why and how firstly much of it is utilitarian short snappy to the point when a fight is tense and evenly matched characters typically only say what is needed in the poppy war during that one-on-one fight between nazar and rin neither of them say anything they only need to focus even in leviathan wakes where there is a lot of dialogue everything is short and snappy to reflect that tense high-paced speed of the situation and every part of it is needed there are ship crew and much of the tension comes from their ability to cooperate and communicate but across the entire fight there are only three lines longer than two sentences all of which are short if characters have the time to monologue then things feel well less urgent secondly dialogue and fight scenes is often emotional the veil of courtesy and social conditioning of normal conversation is stripped back getting to the emotion behind what the characters want to say a lot quicker in the girl with the dragon tattoo slander only says one thing when fighting a serial rapist and killer do you like pain creep her hatred for the guy comes through in this simple one clause question as she hits him it doesn't require a monologue about her traumatic past this isn't shakespeare and because it's so short it doesn't break the pacing of the scene thirdly power imbalance the character that clearly has the upper hand in the fight is the one who often speaks more selander jack torrance the viper for a while when you try your best just as detail can mark shifts in power in the scene it can also be reflected in dialogue as them speaking is a form of them taking control of the scene when writing dialogue in combat keep it on average to one or two short sentences that would be my advice and leave behind any of the fluff of polite conversation and allow emotion to guide the words you use but obviously these are what you call guidelines the actual rules and how dialogue works during a fight will really come down to your writing style and to character who they are and their relationship with their opponent the fight between the viper and the mountain is incredibly fast-paced and tense but that doesn't stop oberon screaming for him to confess this is very in character for him and the book makes a point of how much unnecessary flare he has while fighting that'll probably get him killed and does maybe you want your characters to be having a philosophical debate while they fight and that's okay that is insanely cool it's not necessarily realistic but that might be your style and a lot of readers will like that fiction is fiction folks however there is another element to consider with both dialogue and internalization they both allow you to control the pacing of the fight scene they can give the reader room to breathe with a change of pace however too much internalization or too much dialogue does hamper the pacing as well by slowing the fight scene down and making it feel like you're watching a dvd as your sister has the remote in the other room pressing start pause start pause now studying the micro fight scenes like we did here doesn't get nearly the attention from authors that it really needs but the macro matters too and you should check out author daniel jose older's skillshare class on creative writing essentials which we quoted in today's video which delves more into that structural overall macro level stuff which you can apply to your fight scenes and the first 1000 of you can do it entirely for free by following this link skl.esage hellofutureme2 down in the description below you get two months free of skillshare it's for creative and curious people which i know you are and there is a massive variety of classes which go well beyond writing that you can take on there as well and of course helps the channel immensely thank you if you do and because it would not be a hello future me video without a summary out of a year 7 essay let's get down to business firstly whether using short or long sentences each action beat should be short to maintain fast pacing and tension in a fight secondly verb chains need a sense of cause to effect and chronology this can be achieved with the react pause act and goal conflict disaster structures but these are not required thirdly not every moment of a fight needs to be detailed detail is required where the power balance shifts where characters get closer or further from their goal or in important narrative or character moments fourthly generalized descriptions or creative language allow the reader to get the feel and flow of the fight in non-essential moments fifthly establish the space before the fight especially set pieces that become complications in the fight later this helps the reader follow it and assess intention build up prior tracking the physical movements of characters with important story beats in the fight really helps with visualization sixthly using specific bodily descriptors and describing pain and blows makes it feel grittier and more brutal this is usually accompanied by an emphasis in the fight scene on evading blows seventhly use subjective experience to give depth to the action internalization usually arises from exploring why a fight scene matters and is written with a motive language otherwise physicalize these thoughts with the five senses eighthly dialogue during fight scenes is usually snappy and to the point emotional or reflective of a power imbalance however the biggest factor is your style and character you can use dialogue and internalization to control the pacing but in all of this just remember fight scenes are complicated [Music] and a massive thank you to my youtube peeps who helped voicing some of the book passages for this video you guys did absolutely fantastically all of your channels are linked down below in the meantime let me know one of your fight scenes down in the comments it'd be cool to read some of them stay nerdy and i will see you all in the future

      "rise up comrades rise up for today not only shall we throw off our change those chains of our presses but today we're talking about world building class structures in your fictional society but classes a nebulous term isn't it what does it really mean sociologist Max Weber said that what we're really talking about here is the relationship between three things wealth power and status what he called the three component theory of stratification now these three things do correlate and do cause one another people with power tend to have status and people with wealth tend to have power but just because class structures aren't great doesn't mean that they can have no logic to them divergent damnit I promised myself I'd resist point being having an upper class in an earthlike society with all the wealth but none of the power and none of the status is probably unrealistic world building so when thinking about creating your fictional class structure figuring out how wealth power and status relate is a great foundation I am so excited because today we're going to be discussing all of these fascinating things time stamps are to the site and of course thank you to patrons who make this sort of educational content which is a little bit more niche possible and sustainable thank you so much if you want to join the discord which is full of writers and were builders links are down below hope to see you there let's just jump into it part 1 wealth power and status in other words whatever youtubers don't have in society usually though they do tend to correlate this doesn't mean that these three things always come together old noble classes these days in the UK or Japan may have status and wealth but not a huge amount of power anymore at least relative to what they used to have if scott Fitzgerald's The Great Gatsby explores how though gets be acquires a mints material wealth he is never quite able to attain the same status as those born into money because there comes from your lineage in William Nicholson's the wincing a power comes from academic achievement in their rigorously meritocratic society but being a member of the upper class does not guarantee wealth just an intellectual job this is because status wealth and power do not necessarily come from the same place what is your society culturally value defining status materially value defining wealth and how do people exert political power answering these questions will characterize your characters from each class what they wear eat their mannerisms their job it'll tell you what types of people are in each class and we'll get more into this in our part on class culture historically class structure has been predominantly organized by wealth or the job you have interestingly enough this could be intensified in fantasy or alien societies like the Protoss and Starcraft where some individuals are born for a certain job in a way that humans just aren't aha so Edward says here that you would like to be a masseuse hmm yeah not sure about that you might be best to stick to that hairdresser class yeah yeah just saying this isn't a mark against you but your class isn't really made for it with you know the whole snip snip but your society could be different it could be predominately organized by status or by power instead Ian in Banks's the culture series is based in a post-scarcity world where the economy is fully automated classes thus defined by status how much people like you while you normally expect farmers to be the lowest class and any sort of system during the japanese edo period they actually held a higher status than merchants who were wealthier this was because of a neo-confucian this philosophy that valued essential services like producing food over non-essential services huh no idea why I'm pausing on this no idea how could be possibly relevant to our current geopolitical and sociological circumstances that certainly didn't mean that peasants had more power and wealth than merchants who could travel freely but the more important point here is that when designing a class structure a single stratification paramount rarely fully encompasses the complexities of wealth power and Status the economy culture and politics of society are constantly changing and because of that they're always a little out of sync with one another it takes time for them to influence one another consider how your economy politics or culture changing may mean that a class has less of one of these things than a supposedly lower class part to social mobility the American dream yes that's right if you work hard even you can die in a nicer coffin than a poor person social mobility is how you acquire or lose wealth status or power both together or separately to move through the classes the Song Dynasty is a rare example in history of relative ease with which people could ascend the classes through an imperial exam as Paine taeho writes the second basic concept of Confucian philosophy is that the feudal order could not be salvaged unless it was based on the principle that the wise able and virtuous should rule the competitive civil service examination system became a permanent channel for the recruitment of members of the ruling class though rare for middle or lower class people to ever get the opportunity in the first place it still happened occasionally it was a lot easier for people to acquire status and power through academic excellence though wealth was still very difficult to acquire what we're seeing is what I described discrepancies in the classes of wealth parent status because society was changing and evolving and they were being distributed differently to how they were before maybe instead of academic excellence in your fictional society you might value great military feats or maybe they've been long under a quarantine because of a worldwide plague so they value Baker's like we do now and will forever in the future in a fantastical society it's incredibly common for magic to grant one social mobility the last airbender indicates that firebending allows even peasants to acquire power and status as they fulfill more specialized jobs especially if they support the war effort in this very military society say the people don't get it the fire nation was clearly progressive hashtag women can be war criminals too if you are wanting to have a peasant be allowed to speak to lords in Kings which never happened mind you then magic is one way that writers do this but economically perhaps the most important factor is education how much they get and if different classes get different education 'he's doling rights and class segregation of how incredibly important this is class differences in the UK are almost 100 times higher than race differences as twenty four times as two thousand five hundred percent the class segregation involved in access to higher education is huge the technology of the Industrial Revolution may have created economic opportunity for a rising middle class by freeing up their time and allowing them to upskill but it was the new education system that really underpinned that widespread education worked against the class divided by increasing literacy and numeracy rates and diversifying their job opportunities from oh hey don't care yeah we've got some job openings you can go in factory number one no factory number two no oh oh just for you we've got a refining yeah Factory your Peck suddenly lower middle and upper class children were learning some similar skills even if lords and ladies were also learning to play horse polo and faint on-demand educational opportunity especially at primary and high school levels closes the economic gap in a class system by making it easier to acquire wealth status and power so what skills are members of each class usually being taught and how do these relate to acquiring those three things but it's equally important to figure out which choices or attributes make social mobility harder historically the most obvious ones are your six race religion those sort of things the Umayyad Empire required religious conversion if you were to acquire power in their society and they levy taxes on those that didn't convert making it harder to acquire wealth and run successful businesses ideas of racial hierarchy during the colonial period made it harder for some indigenous groups to attain status Andrzej Sapkowski switcher series is an interesting example of magic actually making you less socially mobile it lowers your status as people see you as this monstrous other a cruel outsider so consider which things in your world both choices your characters make and their inherent attributes make acquiring status power and wealth easier especially education and which things make acquiring them harder but you see the concept of social mobility is complicated by a certain type of class system let's talk about that part 3 caste systems these are slightly different to class systems and that while certain castes will still usually have more or less power status and wealth which caste you are in is usually overtly determined by things you cannot control where you were born such as the Japanese Burakumin or your family in the Indian caste system which influences the jobs you can usually have in Brandon senescence dawn light archives society is divided into people with light eyes and dark eyes this means social mobility is incredibly difficult you can change your eye color only through acquiring a magical item called shard plate which is nearly impossible car systems also sometimes have a class of moral Untouchables people who are entirely socially a mobile who a morally degenerate ought to be cast out they aren't suited like we should have for people who prefer dogs two cats it's for this reason that caste systems are often used in dystopian or grown dark stories like Aldous Huxley's a brave new world which divides people into alphas Vedas gammas deltas and Epsilon's along the lines of genetic superiority it's an easy way to signal to the reader what's wrong with the world why is it terrible and it's it's of narrative goals for an underdog character who is usually the protagonist however fictional species provide a unique opportunity for caste system societies they may work differently to humans with biological factors or abilities that really do segregate society more rigidly without needing to be oppressive you can see this a lot in ant like species with a queen warrior and worker class structure like in Orson Scott Card's in this game in near automata by Yoko taro Android society is divided by function you are either created as a scanner a fighter and operator or a commander this is a caste system of sorts not one we typically recognize but it's not necessarily oppressive it's more of a horizontal class system instead of a vertical pyramid of sorts but I want to point out that class systems and car systems may not be as separate as you might think in a sense there was a caste system explored and the Great Gatsby you have to be born into wealth something you can't change in 1984 scholar dr. Abraham Thomas compared the racially segregated United States to the Indian caste system once divested of its exotic names the car system is nothing more or less than any system of social and equality involving changing patterns of domination exploitation and rebellion I would submit the traditional race relations between blacks and whites in the u.s. are strikingly similar where in state and national political structures in both countries are overwhelmingly controlled by the dominant group the whites in the USA and the upper castes in India importantly though and this is something that stories that want to use a caste system sometimes miss car systems bring with them a stronger philosophical or moral belief about why people should be divided the way they are in a way that normal class systems don't usually this is especially the case for any untouchable class these are often based on historical events and relations between groups in society so consider how your society may be a blend of a class and caste system what philosophy may underpin the way things are struck and who is in each group whither avert or subtle and which historical events and relations those beliefs may be linked to a list of choices and immutable characteristics contributing to social mobility and class may help define your system so you've got an idea on where the wealth power status come from in your society and how they interrelate let's build on that part for class culture classes have cultures within themselves have a talk what they wear what they eat what they do for fun let's not be delusional here though the most important factor is usually wealth more wealthy classes will wear more expensive clothing build more elaborate places eat more and more expensive and more nutritional things and do more expensive things like build giant arenas for poor children to fight to the death and mahogany this is basically being true all throughout history right up to today this is why the Irish prison tree relied on the list nutritious potatoes and abundant hearing fish while its upper class had access to cultivated vegetables and more expensive chicken silk was a mark of the imperial family in China for a time as a rare and beautiful resource and in Harry Potter the upper-class has the luxury of killing muggle-born children in their spare time so in devising internal class culture figure out what food material and pastimes would be even financially available to each class in your world two big factors in this question are geography and trade what can be grown and what materials can be harvested in their environment the wit lowlands and climate of China meant that rice was a more viable resource than wheat the cold weather of Ireland meant potatoes could be grown where other vegetables couldn't usually survive and were thus expensive but geography also necessarily becomes a lot less important with globalized or even interplanetary trade that lowers costs and diversifies the materials and food available to every class consider to what degree free trade impacts what food and material is available to each class but even then the still usually class distinctions even if only made for the point of status in A Song of Ice and Fire having a Valyrian steel sword like the Tolly sword heart's pain is more a signifier of your class than anything else despite it being unusually good metal and in discussing this there is an economic concept called a villain good where demand increases as the price rises largely due to them being status signifiers like luxury cars or watches but they also intersect with power signifiers why buy a thousand dollar suit when a hundred dollar suit serves the same function the answer Veblen said was power we mentioned silk as a sign of the imperial family in China but this was actually legally regulated everyone else was forbidden to wear it status materials and foods often intersect with the legal regulations often in spite of them becoming cheaper due to trade as a way of maintaining those things as status symbols they want to maintain their position so they prevent others from having the things that signify that kind of position consider which things are indicators of each high middle and lower class status which things are unofficially scarce due to regulation to maintain their status and which things are available in goods and materials that not only high status but powerful individuals may acquire but I think that the biggest misconception about class and status is that all of the classes in a society will have the same values and beliefs and practices and symbols they don't not only do all of the different classes have kind of a micro culture within themselves that their own distinct identity but people within a class of a culture don't think the same or act the same or have the same practices which is why when you have these stories that have a heavy emphasis on class culture or the struggle between classes it can be a little bit stilted when all of the lower-class people kind of act the same and think the same and all the middle class people kind of get the same and think the same and all the upper-class people can it the same and think the same when they just kind of don't there isn't that sort of character unity while classes do share cultural elements to an extent great expectations by Charles Dickens makes a point that gloves are a mark of class in Victorian society the finer the material the higher you must be classes also culturally differ due to differences in occupation power religion values and economic pressures different political rights for Athenian women as a class lead to the festival of this m'f Aria which became increasingly associated with the lower classes by the last quarter of the fifth century and men did not attend to this festival it was a divide in cultural practices by class due to different pressures having a steel sword might be a status symbol in the warrior class but not the craftsman class if there seemi equal the religious divide between the poor that Christianity appealed to in the first and second centuries and the Roman rich meant that lower classes valued selfishness in a way that the upper classes didn't and that they believed different things to be morally valuable depending on how magic and technology is viewed by different classes users will hold a different status in each class maybe magic users are used by the upper class to oppress the lower classes so being born a magic user there means everyone kind of hates you figure out what values and practices the classes have in common and then where they differ due to occupational religious and economic differences this is where I think that a class structure will really come to shine it's where it separates it from a very simple and kind of one dimensional class structure that we see in some stories from one that has nuance one that has depth but also consider the differences in language different classes will have different vocabularies they'll use different phrases they'll speak with even different accents especially if those classes are geographically distinct if you want a linguistic gap then come up with a few phrases or speech tropes to mark those differences and represent those in your characters who come from different class and now like a good oppressive car system with me at the top let us divide all of this into seven classes firstly though wealth parent status do correlate they can still be distributed differently across the class system because they come from different places figure out what your society culturally values for status materially values for wealth and the type of political authority for who holds power secondly though they correlate to the distribution of wealth parent status is often out of sync as society changes consider how societal understandings of these things that define class are changing at the time of your story and which of these your class system is mostly based on thirdly consider social mobility in how are you acquire wealth status and power especially in how the economy culture and politics are changing that may allow people to ascend or descend to the class structure magic is often a shortcut available to all classes fourthly consider what things make social mobility easier like technology and levels of education and which things make it harder like social prejudices and legal barriers to entry this is particularly prominent for untouchable classes fifthly car systems based on immutable characteristics make social mobility harder but they don't necessarily have to be oppressive in fictional alien or non human societies consider how your society might be a mix of class or caste systems cultural and legal barriers for a mutable or immutable characteristics sixthly culture will differ from class to class the most important determinant is usually wealth but expensive trade improves the economic diversity of all classes consider what people and goods are in your society and which things are regulated for status reasons simply the biggest misconception about class is that they all share the same values practices and status symbols however due to religious occupational and cultural divides between the classes they will often see different things as marks of status morality and etiquette within their class that may not be the same in other classes so in a shocking twist of events I may have underestimated how complicated class wealth and power is and in my reading I realized that I was going to need more than one video to discuss it I was under the delusion that I could get it all done in half an hour No so there's another part coming to this where we're going to discuss how class and caste systems kind of start which I hinted at in this video and how they collapse how they change how they break how they evolve only with a marxist revolution yeah I'm sorry sorry yeah the meme gets me every time it'll be coming in a month or so the glorious revolution I mean sorry the video the video will be coming in a month or so thank you to

is postponed due to Trotskyist Leninist infighting it is not this day this day we do more world building Theory class or caste systems are a massive part of the way society works and changes it decides who gets to eat cheap fast food and who of you gets to lose their head than their coming revolution last video we looked at how they work and the complex relationship between status wealth and power in detail that video was linked up in the corner now but today we're going to be looking at where class systems come from and how and who maintains these class systems topics are time stamped on

yourself now like all good stories unlike the new out of a spell film we'll start at the beginning part 1 the origins of class as historians and anthropologists professor Melvin Krenz burg and michael T Hannon writes communal activity to organize and harvest food and material and larger groups had important social implications food had to be equally distributed and a leader was needed to organize and direct the group creating a managerial hierarchy by the time written history began distinct economic and social classes were in existence with members of each class occupying a certain place in the organization of work at the apex of the social pyramid stood of the ruler who was often worshipped and the nobles often grown out of a warrior class closely aligned with them with a priest's possessing knowledge of writing and mathematics organizing and directing the economy these are very broad guidelines but three crucial questions for your world building in terms of where all of this came from our a what originally caused people to live in larger groups and fantasy and sci-fi can have lists grounded reasons for this in Tolkien's middle-earth how human society originally formed was impacted by the theology and how they interacted with the kind of Dark Lord figure a god-like being Morgoth he tempted them and some men resisted but some men didn't leading to multiple groups drawing together in conflict with one another there was their need to survive that came from interacting with godlike forces secondly what resources was your society trying to gather more efficiently probably food or water but it could be something else that life really relies on in your world like the spice which gives powers in Herbert's dune or Sakura diet a healing explosive superconductor mineral and Code Geass and finally what religious or philosophical beliefs spread far enough to influence class structures maybe in a world that had buyed massive tsunamis once every decade those who are incredibly good swimmers are revered and raised to an upper class car systems evolved along similar guidelines to these but they tend to put a special emphasis on that third element see car systems are usually accompanied by a strong belief about how the world and people should be organized you there anime weeb your taste in weird and inhuman gasps makes you the highest caste the Hindu Rig Veda forgive my pronunciation divide society into four groups morally distant for their possession magic also significantly affects how your classes form by changing who is powerful how resources are organized and collected what status means the foul felucca feudalistic system in Herbert's dune series evolved to accommodate a group called the been ages arete a sect of magically powerful females the upper classes the great houses are a little bit more gender balanced because they seek to use them as wives and consultants as they compete with one another economically and politically this is also why the emperor almost always has a been ages are at wife plus systems necessarily have to accommodate powerful groups either by oppressing controlling or letting them lead but an important factor is that class systems seem to be often connected to historic conflicts between groups different ethnic groups different tribal groups different professions different religions the Indian caste system can theoretically be traced back to divisions and conflicts between Vedic tribes the arrival of the indo-iranians also contributed to the caste formation as a played a role in those tribal conflicts and the indo-iranians brought with them a particular principle of social ordering cult of Varna which was based on the for hierarchical divisions of function in society skin color was an important indicator in determining an individual's caste the winners of those vedic tribal conflicts seemed to become part of the upper class over time here we see the class divides were not just determined by the organization of Labor and a philosophical belief but by ethnic and religious conflicts the winners and losers like the war between us in the weaves now one kind of reel is a mistake that I see a lot of world builders make is that though they might show us how the class system originated these norms never really change I talked a little bit about this in my video on fictional histories imagine a ten thousand year old conflicts that defines everything in your world for all time ya know see that just doesn't happen there aren't single events that determine all of history all of how society is structured and how the class system works those beliefs and conflicts may have set to the Indian caste system in motion originally but it does not mean that it ever stayed divided along those exact lines especially after thousands of years later the fact is that even in traditional times the car system never existed as if theoretically was supposed to operate my family belongs to the ancient Syrian Christian community in Kerala the Syrian Christians were given a high status in the car system even though strictly speaking the caste system applies only to Hindus the Indian caste system was also radically changed by the British colonization 1881 as they reorganized society even making it firmer in many ways for colonial purposes they wanted to create a synthesis of sorts and fully catalog everyone and this was a way that they did that just as class systems shaped society they too are shaped by that same social environment unless your caste system has only recently started consider how the economic social religious and political realities of the class or caste system have evolved since the start to accommodate sociological and demographic change keeping your class system the same after so long makes your society feel stagnant necessarily healthy classes are structured will be impacted by the type of government that you want a plutocracy would put the wealthy at the top like in Jena government by max berry and a caste system is more likely have a theocracy because of that philosophical backing or at least a strong priest like class and while all of this may have been how class systems originated it's important to remember that they're also often invented more artificially like the neo-confucian assistance where the government kind of just came up with a way that society should be organized during British colonization of India which I mentioned before they drastically changed and hardened to the Indian caste system for colonial reasons they wanted to organize society oppressive governments will sometimes create a class system that aligns with their ideology Jack London's the iron heel demonstrates how a fascist government creates and enforces a class system based on a race that did not arise organically in any way see no system is truly organic nothing is truly arising as organically as I described at the start let's consider the most accurate representation of feudalism ever made Age of Empires I'm kidding but in a sense feudalism is about the organization of Labor more efficiently it's about people gathering together into larger groups for protection and it's also got kind of a philosophical backing with things like the Divine Right of Kings so in a sense you could say this is organic but at the same time there are a lot of practices and rituals and beliefs that really only came into existence to justify the system as it worked to help nobles maintain power they weren't really organically developed and it's your job as the word builder to figure out what the balances what is the organic with the natural divisions in society in your class system and what is official more forced and manufactured by those in power on others part to maintaining a class structure class systems are like any other sociological structure they have to be maintained or they change or they fall apart we like to think of these systems as being about an oppressor class versus the oppressed but that's just not true it's as if millions of Marxist suddenly cried out in terror and were suddenly silenced not because powerful classes cannot be oppressive but because the greatest reason that a class system persists even if it's oppressive is that either one the majority of people believe in the way it works or two they don't see any issue with the oppression class systems like Panem and The Hunger Games with such an overwhelming social divide and purely based on fear are on average a lot more fragile Suzanne Collins even seemed to realize this which is partly why Mockingjay was criticized for a lack of tension the capital fell apart with very little real resistance societies like these with such an overwhelming social divide and purely based on fear can survive for a long time such as these southern states of america or these slave umpires like the ottomans but those typically have a large population who aren't slaves slaves we're numbered two to one in these southern states with this in mind let's look at the legend of korra we can see the massive wealth power and status and equality and bassing say between the three rings but some of the poorest have come to believe that the noble class like the empress deserved the wealth power and status that they do not enjoy there is a religious reverence to it whether or not it's true and that helps maintain it because those with the power have every reason to encourage these beliefs with propaganda and rituals to reinforce this or maybe people wrongly believe that it works as a regress meritocracy this is also why car systems are usually so passive and car systems bring with them a strong philosophical or moral belief about why people should be divided the way they are in a way that normal class systems don't as much questioning the car system becomes questioning society's morality around value and purity even questioning God if you can make an objective a moral imperative for oppressing another group it's much harder to question for both the oppressors and the oppressed secondly perhaps a majority or a large group of people think that the way things work well it's okay they're not the wealthiest or the most powerful or have the highest status but things are fine and those that do have all of them well they deserve it right or those that don't well things all come right for them in time so why force it there is a really nice quote from Martin Luther King jr. that captures the sentiment really well I have almost reached the regrettable conclusion that our great stumbling block in the stride towards freedom is not the Ku Klux Klan er but the white moderate who was more devoted to order than to justice who prefers a negative peace which is the absence of tension to a positive peace which is the presence of justice I think this is a pretty important question to ask when were building your class system does your society have a white moderate class who are largely apathetic that quote is as relevant when we look at today's and justices that are contributors to inequalities such as police murders as it was then hey that house over there is burning yeah but my house isn't burning I mean it's still on fire shouldn't we like have a fire brigade or something have a fire brigade that'd cost us all a lot of money yeah but like that - his house is on fire I understand trust me I hear you but most people's houses aren't on fire i I don't think I don't see a fire anyway yeah the task for you as a world builder is to figure out the combination here between people believing in your system and people not caring about its problems for you to find out how your system is maintained but let's not let the rich and powerful off too lightly they have their dues as well while they're not exactly huddled and secret society going greetings and welcome to the annual meeting of the rich powerful and shady we are here to discuss how this year we shall preserve our wealth power and status in society any suggestions what about beating them with a stick that works last time yes that's a good suggestion write that down beating them with sticks Haran Dean where are the cucumber sandwiches or at least that's what this letter from dr. Illuminati told me to say point being though those with power wealth and status may not be conscious about it they will on average act in ways that reinforce the system because it keeps them on the top it's not really moral but it's pretty natural to do that slave owners and Rome tightened restrictions on freeing slaves the more they became economically dependent on them for their way of life marriage across caste lines in India was outlawed by the highest caste after it saw the decline of the system's influence in daily society weakening their position it took a nearly two hundred and fifty year struggle in the conflict of the orders from 500 to 287 BC for the lower-class plebeians to finally gain similar rights to the upper class patricians of the roman republic who fought it every step of the way it might be easy to say that the warrior or the priestly class holds more wealth power and status because their skills are more specialized and valued by society but those are also the classes that made it so that you couldn't become a knight or attend university without being a noble already yeah but let's get down to specifics here are ten common strategies that you might use in your society to maintain the class system one legal barriers to entering the upper class to difficult cultural barriers to cross such as language and manners which those beneath them would not have like in the great gatsby 3 cronyism like interior Pratchett's making money where the bank manages only give jobs to their friends and family for making less powerful individuals dependent on them for money status who wealth we'll talk about this in a bit five meaningless concessions which placate to the masses six violent force the obvious one seven ostracism casting people out if they dare step out of line eight economic monopolies controlling resources very carefully and their prices nine artificial scarcity of resources especially those that those beneath them really rely on and ten propaganda both obvious and less obvious lots of books use one or more of these more clearly and showing how power is maintained Phillip K Dex do Android Dream of Electric Sheep shows the Rosen Association having a massive monopoly on androids overwhelming and shady corporate power is a huge part to the feel and atmosphere of the world consider what thematic feel you want your society to have and which of these few of methods are the most prevalent in the powerful maintaining power in your world to achieve that but I want to talk briefly about point number three making less powerful individuals dependent on them for money status or wealth this includes massive campaign contributions which is a thing we even see today but let's talk about the Irish during the American Civil War Gleason and the green of the grave writes about how the Irish did not have the status of being truly white in the USA they were considered something else something much lesser but they were often persuaded to help oppress black Americans in order to secure their status as white becoming white mentalist discrimination for their Irishness the Confederacy offered status and thus wealth and power if they were to help the white cause and 40,000 Irishmen did giving people status or wealth or power is an incredibly powerful tool when thinking about how your class system is structured and maintained think about which disadvantaged groups are being incentivized to act in a certain way by giving them the status wealth or power that they really crave and need it's really about what the incentives and barriers are in your society but these are further complicated by magic and technology to kind of nebulous forces because of these things not everyone will necessarily face the same barriers or have the same incentives due to drastically different capabilities Superman doesn't really need to worry about earning money like your ordinary person for food he gets it from the Sun like he plant we talked before in the last video about how this impacts social mobility that is moving between up or down through classes but it does mean that the rich and powerful need to have an answer to why magic and Technology don't break the system when a significant group of people do not need to be dependent on them for power or can finally oppose force or they don't need to rely on resources that the rich and powerful control in world building your sci-fi or fantasy world how do the rich and powerful incentive eyes this unique group to act in the way they want or what extra barriers do they create specifically for them Fullmetal Alchemist gets around this by highly privileged illumise who serve the state like Edward and Roy Mustang with money status and power all of this is why the trend is the higher the class the fewer the people it's very easy to go down but difficult to go up this is what makes answering that question what does your society value so difficult because status is often defined by those who already have status even if they don't realize it it's why lower-class Asiatic people learn English it's the language of the wealthy class worldwide British people even learned French after the bell of Hastings in 1066 because it brought in a French upper class gaining power meant learning French the lower classes play to the whims of the upper class to gain status power and wealth not because they necessarily want to but because they kind of need to and that's it my people I have solved the economy I in my infinite wisdom have summarized everything there is to say about class wealth and power in two 20 minute videos bow down before my incredible intellect just kidding turns out in a shocking twist of events I underestimated how complicated a topic could be which means that I've got a third part coming out in while about how class systems change and fall and with it the final Marxist rebels once again cheers to chem fire for sponsoring this revolution in world building video I have done a whole review of this product a couple of times before and that video is linked in the corner now because chem fire is a program designed for writing and world building which is what you guys are interested in and because of that I want to be a bit more careful when recommending it but to start I wholly recommend camp fire and the world building pack especially if you are into world building languages magic systems or fictional species if that is you or you just want to give it a try totally for free then go to this link in the description and you'll get ten days to try it out however you like but I'm going to go through my main positives and criticisms as well here to give you the gist the world-building Pegg gives you pages for species cultures religions philosophies magic systems and items but it's clearly the magic systems page that had a lot of effort put into it especially if follows Sanderson's setup with places for rules costs limitations the source history and so on the languages page though really astounded me I have never really seen a program quite like it with an inbuilt system for phonetics grammar pragmatics a dictionary and a place for your own alphabet it's built in a way that most programs really aren't secondly I think it's particularly suited for Dungeon Master's and role players the items page allows you to give stats for any items you create like a damaged weight powers etc I also personally love the character profile feature how it works and just kind of how it looks it's a feature that some worlds building software's kind of lack but it serves campfire well and what's really cool that other programs don't often do is that you can export your character profiles to a PDF making them really easy to use in your games because I know as a DM how having paper is a lot more efficient than ever having a laptop in general everything is pretty easy to engage with and figure out I do think that the Encyclopedia could be better integrated with the map so that you click on locations to bring articles up and I think that it could benefit from different types of smaller icons to know different things like cities mountains castles spaceships so there's a couple of things that I think they really should work on there and I've mentioned a few other things as well and my other of you but overall I highly recommend camp fire Pro and especially the world building pack to diems role players and world builders if you are wanting more detail reviews then do go check out that in the linked video but now with me as your glorious infallible dictator let us summarize all we have learned and discussed today firstly class systems arise initially as a result of living in larger groups the organization of labor conflict between groups and philosophical beliefs spreading car systems tend to put more emphasis on those philosophical beliefs magic however will significantly change the reasons behind all these things secondly though a class system may begin with a certain geopolitical sociological religious or philosophical setup these things will change the longer the class or caste system persists keeping it the same makes your world feel stagnant thirdly class structures are most securely maintained by a majority believing in the way it works or not seeing any issue with the oppression systems based purely on fear are more fragile this is why car systems are also more persistent fourthly class systems are self reinforcing systems largely regulated by those who already have wealth status and power consciously and unconsciously through legal and cultural barriers cronyism dependency violence ostracism monopolies artificial scarcity propaganda meaningless concessions and more and fifthly it's fundamentally about where the incentives and barriers are in your society consider how magic and technology change or remove these incentives and the barriers for some groups and ask how the rich and powerful therefore incentivize them to act the way they want that is all from me this video was fun to put together I really love doing well building videos cuz I just get to look into cool things in history in our world and fiction as always come join me on Instagram Twitter that sort of stuff I try to answer questions when people send them to me as much as I sort of can you know it's a bit hard to do everything but um thank you if you do you guys are awesome cheers to my patrons you guys obviously make this content possible especially all those who have joined in the last month massive numbers i standed thank you so much in the meantime stay nerdy and I will see you in the future you\n",

      "you can almost say and i know you've been waiting for this class systems are complicated [Music] yes comrades the revolution is finally here however the revolution will not be televised not shown on this video you can serve the revolution by sharing this video anywhere and everywhere how did we get from a slave society to a free one from feudalism to capitalism fiction is often about radical change in the social order especially sci-fi and fantasy and class systems are an important element of realizing your world's history and why your world is the way it is understanding this sort of thing can give your world that little bit of extra depth so let's talk about how class systems fall or change but full center more dramatic so i want to say that we're going to do this in five parts peaceful change violent change what happens after class plague and war oh now cheers to the writing and world building software campfire for sponsoring this video we'll be reviewing it later part one peaceful change class systems can change or end when the barriers to class mobility significantly lower allowing people to cross into different classes easily and this is either up or down thus the class system as they know it ceases to exist like i don't know imagine if millennials could no longer buy a house a critical part of entering the middle class a good example of this is from the tang dynasty the competitive civil service examination system for the recruitment of the members of the ruling class account of the decline of the pre-tang and early tang aristocracy the chinese examination system made it radically easier for non-nobles to enter the ruling class here those barriers to rolling of being rich noble or already powerful were undermined by a new political religious idea to the point that it marked the decline of an old aristocracy it was a massive shift in the class system of the day what is this poor people getting an education not on my watch a major factor to consider here are guilds and unions which have been important players in breaking down changing or even reinforcing barriers to social mobility historically we see how this works in the elder scrolls series the emergence of the fighters guild lent power wealth and status to layman under a feudalistic system that they otherwise would not have members have legal exemptions for weapons can demand higher payments for jobs and are well respected guilds and unions give people a lot of bargaining power that challenge the way the class system works consider what unique privileges of power wealth and status that guilds and unions give its members guilds and unions like the uk miners in the 1980s have used their control of a large portion of the economy to boycott or pressure government bodies to enact laws that they want both unions and guilds increase the social mobility of their members but they can also restrict the social mobility of non-members by either denying membership or resisting change that would disadvantage them becoming part of the structures of a new class system themselves the likes of local morrow by scott lynch alludes to how guilds can become so powerful manipulative of individuals in its world building one night a powerful sorcerer knocks on the door of a less powerful sorcerer hey i'm starting an exclusive guild he says join me now or i'll blast you out of your boots right where you stand so naturally the second mage says you know i always wanted to join a guild right repeat as necessary until three or four hundred guild members are knocking on the door of the last independent major round and everyone who said no is dead in other words class systems are complicated a second way the class systems peacefully change or end is if the philosophy behind how the class system should work changes government programs in both japan and india working to help low-caste people who have been historically discriminated against reflect a changing belief in the validity of the caste system even in 1984 dr abraham thomas wrote does caste exist in india sure it does but not the same as it was 200 years ago or even 100 or even 20 years ago for an example from our modern day society journalist ben tarnoff writes today's top executives are devoted work worshippers these individuals aren't working out of necessity it's about the display of productivity as a symbol of class power in an era of extreme inequality elites need to demonstrate to themselves and others they deserve to own orders of magnitude more wealth than everyone else what we're seeing is that our own class system which largely accepted inherited wealth is now changing as political and economic tensions begin to climb to emphasize non-inherited wealth our definition of status is changing and the class system is too but these are good changes right well a lot of these are the nazis are also an example of people changing their philosophy to believe in a class system based on racial hierarchy and loyalty to the state not all social change is good so consider one positive changes to the distribution of wealth power and status and two negative changes to the distribution of wealth power and status across history part two violent change finally the more exciting stuff why would you have healthy gradual class change when you can have blood now revolution and civil war happen for a myriad of reasons so we're just going to focus on the class aspects of it class tensions are major internal economic and political forces in society so it's no surprise that the 1917 russian revolution the spanish civil war the finnish civil war the chinese revolution and so many others are underpinned by class tensions the different sides aren't just ideologically different but economically different though lower class people are of course conscripted to either side without much choice charles dickens explored this in his book a tale of two cities he goes out of his way to highlight the economic and social divide that led up to the french revolution more than he did the ideas of liberty justice and blah blah blah all that sort of nonsense which is what we often talk about when we think of the french revolution see though historical it was important word building to help us believe and understand how the revolution was inevitable or realistic those idealistic concepts might be there for your heroes but the average working person is more concerned with peace bread and land before they're thinking about those higher ideas popular support for violent class change doesn't spring out of nowhere consider showing the economic tensions that underpin the divide and more importantly the economic reform that both sides believe need to happen and with a peaceful or violent it's important to consider whether the change is top down or bottom up so you know here in shakespeare's hamlet actually no let's go with the lion king otherwise known as hamlet but fluffy scar rules the land placing the hyenas higher in the class system than they ought to be and the land suffers for it but then simba becomes king and he heals the land from a position of wealth power and status this is a top-down change in contrast the slaves of the mastery by william nicholson shows a radical slave society being overthrown by a class of enslaved people who have no power wealth and little status this is bottom-up change now in fiction these two different types of change provide for usually different types of stories top-down change stories allow for lost ears to the throne a more idealistic ending like the return of the king where defeating a bad ruling class solves the problems without worrying too much about the more complex real world questions and that's okay not every story needs to go into this sort of stuff it's also important to know that real world top-down change is often a little out of touch with reality because fewer people are involved in making decisions and this can lead to economic and social problems in contrast change stories typically allow for underdog characters revolutionary tales like mistborn where the ark is them acquiring wealth power and status till they can challenge the status quo real world bottom-up change is grassroots democracy but it's also often more violent because it naturally brings those without power wealth and status into conflict with those who do though historically an important factor in this type of change is some support from the top in some form catching fire by suzanne collins explores this through plutarch heavensby who works with the resistance from the capital to get katniss out part three after class littlefinger was right when he said chaos is a ladder in a storm of swords by george r martin daenerys overthrows the slave-driven class system of astapor chaos was left in its wake now daenerys did set up a council to rule the city with a semi-egalitarian class system but it doesn't stick a group of ex-slaves now a free class forcefully take power and the council cannot stop it see the council doesn't really control the city's resources or the military not really but this faction of ex-slaves become a strong enough force to do so see class isn't just an idea class is about the realistic and practical distribution of power wealth resources opportunity social standing so a change in the class system is often just really about a redistribution of those things to different groups of people creating a new class system which may be better or worse as for how that happens think about which group practically controls resources and military force afterwards they will form an important part of the new social class order regardless of the war or revolutions idealistic aims it's about who has the infrastructure to support them afterwards think about kuvira in the legend of korra she takes over after an anarchist plot decimates the ruling class of bar singh say the capital she's a military leader and the military is one of the only factions left with a nationwide organizational infrastructure left they pick up the pieces and who is there to challenge them the french revolution is famous for turning to tyranny and its aftermath see a new class system will often form out of the remnants of the last especially if there is chaos or violence this is also a really fascinating place for a story a post-revolution world where they're trying to realize these revolutionary ideals but it's more complicated than that this is kind of the world of a song of ice and fire it's after the revolution trying to realize these new ideas and well and things go pretty wrong pretty quickly you could take a deep look at what a world is like from the perspective of people who didn't have any wealth power or status before and suddenly find themselves in a new order where they have too much of it or too little of it the reality is class isn't simple no class systems are complicated realistically class systems change but they always leave a remnant of the past of sorts frankenberg's dune series sees the fall of the farfalug feudalistic system which uses terms like lord viceroy and duke but these terms survive the class system's end and they evolve in what they mean in the book heretics of dune everything doesn't just suddenly change like that we can see the history and how he will build this new kind of class system the question for you as the world builder is this what class systems did your society go through in the past and how is that reflected now linguistically socially and economically part four plague during the feudal age peasants were replaceable labor help help i'm being repressed bloody peasant but after the black plague that wasn't so true anymore forcing the feudalistic class system to change to give them wages wealth and their skills were rarer giving them a kind of status the nobility did try to stop this with immense taxes and the statute of labor is in 1351 but economic and social pressures won out and succeeded over time with the end of feudalism so firstly plague can change the economic worth of large classes of individuals as their skills become more valuable during and after the plague giving them leverage in changing the class system secondly people fled the cities during the black play to the countryside the rich and the poor the result was a decentralization of power across europe as cities declined where disease has struck historically will shift the geographical centers of power wealth and status like capital cities in your world as the upper class either flees or they die and new powers rise up thirdly this is all intensified by disease impacting lower income families more on average tolkien wrote about a great plague across middle earth that was greater in ravanin which had no great cities its people were little skilled in the arts of healing and medicine lower classes or less advanced civilizations lack health care have fewer resources and often an inability to self-isolate this means that there may be differences in the class system distribution of wealth power and status depending on where the disease strikes the working class of the placehead hardest may be able to demand more in the post-disease world leading to an emergent middle class part five war war challenges the class system in a similar way to how plague does as people shockingly die world war one meant that those who had previously been part-timers or casual laborers or unemployed could suddenly earn good money and feed themselves however it also challenges the class norms that underpin wealth power and status in britain women became an employee class in factories and shops to help the war effort and it meant that they demanded the vote getting power but the relationship between class and war also heavily depends on how popular the war is as york university history professor gerald jordan wrote conscription and the direction of labor made for a more inclusive sense of national identity in 1914 britain nationalism was one legacy of the war although war sensitized workers class and equality national sentiments in popular culture set limits on the political consequences of class feeling war can give a cultural feeling of purpose to inequalities it can be used by the powers it be to quell those tensions or create a sense of a bigger picture but this doesn't always work in contrast russia [Music] in world war one they had long work hours the costs of living were already an issue and they were made worse due to the demands of the war and it all contributed to the 1917 bolshevik revolution the bolsheviks promised peace bread and land and that's because when you strip away the facade of idealistic concepts of justice and equity people just want to go home and have stability if there are class tensions then how popular is that war which tensions is it making worse and which is it easing though i do want to note that war doesn't usually stop these tensions it just puts them on pause for a few years often then returning with a vengeance seriously go read about how many strikes there were in germany in world war one during the war and then after the war all of it leading up to well you know what and if you want to codify or visualize your class system alongside your magic system species or world timeline then campfire and their world building expansion allows you to have an encyclopedia which would make it pretty easy to lay out how your class structure works and how different groups perceive their wealth power and status it's a software designed for writing and world building and i've already done an extensive review of campfire before it's linked up in the corner now because i want to be really open and honest when talking about this sort of thing but bottom line campfire and the expansion is really good especially if your well building magic systems and languages i mean look at this page it's awesome i really do think would be a great place for you to get down just how your class system works and more importantly how it intersects with the rest of your world building because campfire is really built to be able to do that campfire does have a 10-day totally free trial down at the link below so i encourage you to go check it out and just see if it helps you and if you like it it's only a one-time purchase which i really appreciate in the era of subscription services there's also a fantastic timeline feature for you to map out how your class system evolved over time which i think is a really important part i do think the encyclopedia could be better integrated with the map so that you click on locations and it brings articles up and the map could use different icons like cities and mountains castles and spaceships but i do mean this when i say that i recommend campfire as a way to organize your world building and connect it all together especially for role players by the way as the item and character pages are really equipped for d d stance links are down below you get a cool word building software and it supports the channel and for the summary i'm gonna channel my year three english teacher all right class what have we learned today tim get that out of your mouth firstly peaceful ways class systems change include lowering barriers to social mobility and people changing their beliefs about the justification of social stratification guilds and unions are often important players in reinforcing or challenging the status quo consider what kind of story you really have and whether the change should be top down or bottom up to fit that secondly revolution and civil war often have science that come from broadly different economic classes likewise however idealistic your conflict is showing the economic tensions underpinning the violent class divide helps with realism thirdly consider which groups control the resources infrastructure and military after a radical shift in the class system especially if there's chaos they will be an important part of the new class system holding some combination of wealth power and status regardless of the idealistic games fourthly class systems may change but remnants of the history will always remain consider how past class systems are reflected in the language organization political structures and otherwise fifthly plague significantly impacts whose skills grow in value giving them more leverage it will also change the geographical concentration of wealth and power as cities decline and different groups are affected more weakening or strengthening their place in the class system and sickly war can mobilize groups into the economy leading to their political agency it can exacerbate economic tensions and it can lead to nationalistic unity depending on the popularity of the war all i've got to say now is join the

      "oh hey momo see with that i now understand that you as a character like your element lightning are volatile but powerful with your anger prone to get out of control this has been a lesson in elemental magic good evening everyone it is 2021 welcome to the channel a place of refuge and certainty in these hard times because unlike other places in the world here on hello future me we have a stable political system not prone to coups and our supreme empress momo all hail momo elemental magic systems are like your average office water cooler they're cool and they've got water i know it was a bad joke don't get fired up about it and i know why you would want to write one when i was 13 i wrote this fantasy book which will never see the light of day about these four kids who could all control one element and they were called guardians and the main guy controlled air and they could go into this rage mode called status as you can tell originality was my strong suit but let's talk about how you might do one well nowadays oh and do you like reading and do you have ears well now you can read my book on writing and word building with your ears it's an audio book number one bestseller on this channel's best seller list uh it's already sold 23 000 copies and everyone knows that books that sell well must be good uh it's also read by some really cool people larissa and murph you might know them it's got like all of the on writing and we're building chapters in an easy to read and reference books so you know links down below and not just on amazon it's on a bunch of different places that aren't owned by amazon if you don't want to give them any of them because people wanted that cool links down below i don't mean to be a downer but uh elemental magic systems aren't that original but come on we are used to the common four or five elements all over the place so here are two ways to be more original with an elemental magic system one it's not the elements but how you use them narratively that matters the great thing about elemental magic is that we already have these cultural associations with each element fire and anger water and healing life and energy this makes it really easy to code characters and things in your world with ideas and personality traits the character aravos in the dragon prince is aligned with the stars and the writers use how we project a sense of wonder or power mystery that we find in the night sky to inspire these same feelings in this equally mysterious character zuko's fire bending is an analog for his hot-headedness and struggles with anger throughout the series while katara's motherly and healing character is expressed through her water bending by using these natural assumptions that we as readers all have elemental magic creates a more visceral and visual way of exploring and manifesting these character traits magic can become an analog for character growth struggles attributes right from the beginning of your story and you can more easily pull readers into caring about your characters because of it we don't have this natural connection with say the power of the witches in the northern lights to separate from their daemon we don't really know what this means for who they are what they believe what their personalities are like so understanding who they are because of it takes phillip pullman a lot more time to explain in the story and it's not just about characters but dynamics between your characters common tropes connected to elemental magic are the five-man band and the power trio you'll know them you've seen them in a ton of stories i promise these are common character setups you've got the leader the lancer the smart guy the big guy and the heart of the group they all fill a specific emotional or narrative role and can do things that nobody else in the group really can elemental magic for obvious reasons fits in pretty well with this by dividing the elements between characters you give everyone a unique role and you can tie in how the characters relate to one another to how their elements relate to one another the smart guy might let his intellect get in the way of him being empathetic and kind while the heart might let her emotions get in the way of her being smart the show which does exactly this with irma being the big guy and having her controlling the earth element while heilin is the heart of the group and she controls air these are two opposite people within the group and they have two opposite elements in contrast the power trio might have two characters who are diametrically opposed they typically disagree and so they have fire and water and then one person caught in between them again you can use these associations to create a magical metaphor of sorts for character relationships giving them a new way to express it and a new way for you to visualize it in your story but this is also a weakness a lot of the reason that elemental magic feels so samey and unoriginal a lot of the time is that authors are using these common associations to do the same character arcs and character dynamics that we have seen a million times before oh the fire user's arc is about controlling his anger wow would have never thought of that the earth wizards arc is about them being more flexible well eat my cat and call me wally i've never heard that one before part of being original here is not only finding new associations for the elements but also finding different roles for the magic to play narratively this is why jack frost in rise of the guardians is pretty damn cool i love that film he completely breaks their association of ice being slow grim connected to darkness or even death and he makes it about being fun and rebirth and living in the moment it's a fundamental part of his character arc to find his place in the world but it's not an arc that we've seen really associated with ice magic before jim butch's codex alera series associates earth with lust and being in the moment it's an uncommon association but it's one i can totally get behind because it's about being grounded [Music] it's about your desires and needs in the real physical world as for the different narrative roles it can play in your story it doesn't need to be used as an analog for your character arcs or traits it can be used to explore the world the tone the themes nania's world being overtaken by a magical icy winter tells us immediately that this world is unforgiving and grim when it could be so much more because of our cultural emphasis on the coming of spring even though winter is better and you will dare well know it but it also creates a tonal childish wonder through lucy's eyes in brandon sanderson's mistborn series the magic system is used to explore the industrial revolution that the world is undergoing in the unsurprisingly named a song of ice and fire series by george r martin fire and ice magic are intensely related to the themes he wants to explore barrack dondarrion's repeated fire magic resurrection helps explore how death is the ultimate equalizer and that the ability to die is part of what makes us more human the mysterious winter ice magic of the north is more about creating an eerie atmosphere and somber tone to his writing robert jordan's the wheel of time uses the divide between the masculine fire and earth magics and female water and ear magics to explore gender relations see i find stories with elemental magic systems to be pretty tonally neutral they're not inherently whimsical or grim dark they're the rainbow technicolor dream goat of aesthetics consider adding elements that change the tone or inform what you want maybe earth magic kills plants around you making it more of a grim dark world full of sacrificial magic or perhaps the fire is controlled through upbeat saxophone music making the world full of whimsical wizards who did it with a saxophone yeah baby you thought the meme was gone but it is back what i'm trying to get at here is i want you to think about what you want your elemental magic to do in your story narratively what does it inform thematically tonally and worldly yeah sure how does it affect who your characters are and how you represent them yeah but maybe think about doing things that haven't been done so much before the second way to make them more original is pretty simple the elements themselves in aaron has the dragon prince the elements aren't based around the classical four or five but around the sun the moon the stars the earth the sky and the ocean it's familiar and still results in lightning being thrown around but the aesthetic and framing is fundamentally different to how we would usually imagine it there are also expressions of these powers that we haven't seen before the moon leads to invisibility and the sun which is comparable to fire can manifest in healing abilities that burn away sickness sanderson's mistborn series is an even weirder and more brilliant example of elemental magic it uses real elements i mean like iron and zinc and tin it's based around metals on the periodic table using tin can sharpen your senses iron allows you to pull on metals that are nearby it is an elemental magic system sure but again its design and how it's used in the story does not feel familiar in the slightest i tend to find that new and interesting elemental setups all have one thing in common an inventive unifying theme like the dragon prince and mistborn things aren't just different for the sake of it i once read a story by a friend of mine where they chose kinetic shadow sound and light as their four elements it was distracting how obviously they were just trying to be different from the original four or five there was no uniting theme to those powers and they didn't add enough to the world or characters to be worth the awkwardness i mean readers notice this kind of stuff if you're just trying to be different don't call it wind energy nature and ice don't just be different for the sake of being different be different and be clever and unifying themes really help with that now it wouldn't be a magic systems video without referencing sanderson's three laws your ability to solve problems with magic is proportional to how well the reader understands said magic limitations are more important than powers and go deeper before you add more okay so on the first one they can make fire but how much and to what degree can a character control it i mean you can't really weigh fire sometimes it's hard to communicate all of this the true capabilities of your characters to the reader costs such as exhaustion are common in elemental magic systems but they are prone to feeling contrived when the character has just enough energy to do what's needed because plot or just not enough when they need to fail because plot i think rick riordan the author of the percy jackson series has a pretty good grasp on how to deal with this problem percy jackson can control the element of water but riordan writes his story so that percy tends to use a certain set of abilities over and over again this repetition allows the reader to understand his capabilities and the problem solving in the story almost always comes down to how he can use those pre-established powers things he has done before to solve a different problem consider establishing a certain set of elemental skills that your characters might have and reusing them to create a sense of consistency helping the reader as well understanding how you solve the lot so that it doesn't feel like a wizard did it with the second law limitations can come in any form that you want maybe they can only lift their body weight or perhaps the water elemental they bargained with for their powers can veto their abilities at any time or fire mages can't use their powers at night and given the magic is often used to reinforce those character dynamics you can think about how these limits might play into those dynamics as well what is one person limited in that another person isn't what can one person do in the group that the other person can't finally go deeper rather than add this is related to a problem i mentioned at the start sometimes when people are running out of ideas what do they do add a new element don't know how to make the magic cooler add a new element need another character add a new element fight scenes aren't cool enough add a new element yeah no legend of korra did not add new elements but deepened the elements that it already had in season three zaheer and airbender lets go of all of his earthly attachment and he gains the ability to fly i really liked this it was something that played into the association ear has with spirituality and flexibility this is about going deeper into the powers they had already established so think about it what are some innovative and unique associations you could have with each of those elements and from those associations unique powers that might come from each of them when you go deeper throughout the story see going deeper also helps with rule 1 because it helps the readers understand the powers better and that helps you solve things in the plot more creatively it's just great but of course wouldn't be a writing video without a summary for you firstly originality is more about how you use the elemental idea narratively than simply having a different elemental setup it's common to use it as an analog for character so consider using the elements to explore theme tone and setting instead rather than repeat common character tropes and arcs that we've seen before secondly cultural elemental associations allow us to code characters and places with traits without necessarily exploring them that deeply however using common cultural associations can feel less original consider finding new associations and therefore expressions of your elements thirdly elemental magic systems fit perfectly with common character dynamics like the 5-man band or the power trio you can use these elements to reflect how these group dynamics work such as giving opposite characters opposite elements fourthly elemental systems are often tonally bland consider adding details that inform the tone and atmosphere that you want to craft and fifthly in creating consistency with powers it can be helpful to establish a series of skills that your characters have and return to limitations are important to consistency and they can be used to inform those character dynamics consider using unique associations in order to go deeper into your element before adding new powers that is all for today people remember brand spanking new audio

      "character descriptions are hard to write you can almost say character descriptions are complicated so i've been studying 35 character descriptions by brilliant authors across a ton of genres why they work and what we can learn from them and what i learned from them personally because i kind of struggle with character descriptions too and maybe at the end of the video i'll even show you some of my writing yeah i am only able to take the time to research this hello my mom take the time to research this kind of video because of patrons so thank you now we will only be looking at 16 of the 35 descriptions that i studied today but my analysis of all 35 what we can learn from them stuff that didn't make it into this video is available to all patrons if you would like that extra analysis for the books we discussed now and entirely original notes as well on books like the game of thrones lolita paper towns the book thief or you'd just like to support me and your supreme empress momo then it's all available there thanks again part one vivid physical descriptions you know vivid character descriptions do not just come from describing a list of random physical features because not only do physical attributes of your character like height eye color or shoulder shape not really matter that much by themselves but readers can find it hard to remember a lot of them so just heaving a slew of adjectives and nouns at the reader doesn't even help them get to know the character that much her leafy green bulbous round eyes were so moon like her dark long hair was like a luscious tall dark waterfall on a dark night her curvy wavy round hips were so ready for child bearing this is why in save the cat blake snyder advocates for highlighting a single or few memorable or distinguishing features that set a character apart like a limp or an eyepatch he calls it so let's look at how william gibson uses this technique in his foundational cyberpunk short story burning chrome chrome her pretty childlike face smoother steel with eyes that would have been at home on the bottom of some deep atlantic trench cold grey eyes that lived under terrible pressure they said she cooked her own cancers for people who crossed her the focus here is on her distinctive dark eyes that hint at her darker nature and a vivid image forms around them a limp or an eye patch but gibson actually does more than just this see unlike the film medium i as a writer cannot get you to perfectly envision my characters the way i do and spending endless words trying to do so just isn't worth it beyond that it actually undermines the reader's ability to engage with the text on their own terms to imagine things in their own way which is one of the real strengths of the textual medium so instead gibson contrasts other characters with chrome two other times with wildly different descriptions of the same thing their eyes characters are very simply separated in our minds this way but it's also worth noting that her eyes aren't actually that abnormal a distinctive feature can be freckles from childhood that haven't melted away auburn hair the glisten sunset or skin that becomes a patchwork of pink and cream in the summer sun normal stuff but something that marks them out nonetheless no other characters have eyes as dark as hers and i reckon that was intentional you'll also notice the strength of the adjectives metaphors and similes chrome doesn't just have dark grey eyes but cold grey eyes that lived under terrible pressure the first describes them factually while the second brings in other connotations like that chrome is calculating conniving and necessarily ruthless consider the words that you use and ask are you just stating the facts or are you giving other connotations about the character and that's why it's worth noting that when i studied these descriptions just how much i found that great description didn't come from hair or eyes but with part two posture movement and facial expressions if scott fitzgerald actually describes gatsby almost entirely through his smile in his introduction he smiled understandingly much more than understandingly it was one of those rare smiles with a quality of eternal reassurance in it that you may come across four or five times in life it faced or seemed to face the whole eternal world for an instant and then concentrated on you with an irresistible prejudice in your favor i know how tempting it is to just describe physical features because we want them to know what they look like but sometimes facial expressions movement and posture can do a way better job at communicating character charles dickens conjures an image of scrooge just from saying he was a squeezing wrenching grasping scraping clutching covetous old sinner nearly entirely movement and this is all because of something that just became so apparent to me as i studied all of these descriptions that the best ones didn't just tell us what the characters looked like with fancy and pretty words they part three tell us about who they are it's always going to be a mixture of their eyes their body shape how they move their posture their scars their freckles descriptions will have some but not others with each different character i mean none of these books had everything and trying to give it all its futile and i think that's because the authors of all of these descriptions figured out that it's not about communicating the most information that instead it's about knowing and choosing which things best tell us about their character you know in burning chrome is her dark eyes and the librarian auschwitz it's here's his posture the way he moves and the great gatsby it's his smile focusing purely on the looks of a character is a relatively surface level way of getting to know them but what you choose to show and how you describe it can show the reader deeper things their psychological state their flaws their worldview their personality thought patterns anything let's look at some examples of how some unexplained accident had taken the other eye and the missing orb had been replaced by a ball of glass the result was disconcerting but what bothered lord downey far more was the man's other eye the one which might be loosely called normal he'd never seen such a small and sharp pupil t-time looked at the world through a pinhole not only does pratchett here focus on describing a single distinctive physical characteristic like we discussed his eyes but the way he describes it leans into how mr tiertaime hyper focuses on things he becomes obsessed with things to a fault and he views the world through that very narrow lens in other words he looked at the world through a pinhole i mean martin's not known for exactly being concise but in a game of thrones martin doesn't describe the inscription on king robert's armor or the colour of his eyes but instead focuses on how he smells how fat he is his unkempt beard because they highlight his flaws he has become lazy and more concerned with pleasure than ruling the kingdom which things you choose to describe and how you describe them can communicate so much about the character to the reader so don't just look for distinctive visual features but features that come from their quirks their flaws their strengths beliefs and struggles a wedding ring isn't distinctive by itself unless the man's wife has already been dead for 30 years and he can't let her go but i want to highlight something okay i want to highlight just how many of these descriptions and more were made so potent by using character bias things the perspective character wants that they hate that they believe in will shape what they focus on and how they describe it especially in first person and third person limited it's a little bit different when it's a narrator outside of them a great example of this is an amy bender's short story what you left in the ditch a story about a wife whose husband loses his ellipse in an explosion while on military duty he's unable to kiss her and she begins to resent him for that so when she's out she's describing another man and she says the young man there had always had lips but now they seem twice as large and full and incredible as if his face was overflowing with lip while he ran her milk and eggs and toothpaste over the electronic sensor she couldn't stop looking at them guess what they tasted like the warm salty taste of flesh how she describes this other man tells us less about him than it does about her her perspective created a bias to describe the man's lips it's dehumanizing the way she does it she doesn't even give him a name it's just carnal and primal this description of someone else captures her desire for the taste of flesh in a kiss and the way she frames them may not even be true i know i like to focus on a character's thoughts their feelings their features but so much of characterization comes from how a character interacts with the things and people around them in patricia mccormick's cut kelly describes a number of girls at the hospital struggling with mental illness like her and the way she does it tells us about kelly's psychological state our problems are called issues the rest like me are assorted psychos we're called guests with behavioral issues and the place is called a residential treatment facility it is not called a loony bin tara a skinny girl who has to wear a baseball cap to cover a bald spot where her hair fell out and becca another really skinny girl who wears little girl tights that pool around her ankles by defining others around her by traits that identify their mental illnesses it tells us that she is also defining herself by her struggles and self-harm there's also this emphasis on labels and a big part of kelly's arc in the story is coming to see herself as more than that that label and these carrots descriptions help to set that up mccormick shows us that you can give descriptions of really standard bodily features like body shapes and hair but the description is really about communicating kelly's struggles in both of these cases how someone else is described is used to characterize the narrator what the wife craves in the first and kelly's psychological state in the second what biases concerns jealousies memories do your characters have and how do those things a affect which features they describe in others or themselves and b how they describe them this is especially true for first person writing where are already inside their head but as is what's the case with what you left in the ditch it's also very true for third person limited it's a little bit different when it comes to an omnipotent narrator but it can affect that as well i mean everyone knows the laughable way a trait of the main character randomly looking in the mirror and describing themselves as an excessive detail i wouldn't usually look at myself in the mirror but that day i did for some reason i was very normal my hair was exactly the color i remembered it was somehow my eyes were too but at least i had my curvaceous hips ready for child bearing people just don't do that they don't think like that but this is a challenge how do you describe your narrator when writing in first person it's hard i looked at quite a few examples of this but i think that ned vizzini's it's kind of a funny story actually does this really well it's a story about someone who has growing urges to kill themselves and yes unsurprisingly i read a lot of books about mental health and this happens as those thoughts escalate i look so normal i look like i've always looked like i did before the fall of last year dark hair and dark eyes and one snaggled tooth big eyebrows that meet in the middle a long nose sort of twisted pupils that are naturally large which blend into the dark brown to make two big saucer eyes holes in me this is craig and i always look like i'm about to cry i love that expression holes in me the language here invokes feelings that reflect craig's emotional state in the first part there's the sense of being stuck immobile unable to escape i think the key though isn't the second part vizzini leans heavily into using craig's biases what he thinks of himself in particular craig is berating himself for his looks only describes things in a negative way and focuses on negative things because of this self-loathing that he feels which all builds into those suicidal urges shalom bishop leans into those biases in a different way by having the character compare themselves to a girl they wish was their daughter and i will never tell you this black braids blue raincoat gumboots 10 years old your daughter moved like an otter with curious seal but she had my hair glossy like oil dark eyes like mine skin beige like mine a young face still easily attributed to me to everyone but you we could have been father and daughter in both cases the first person narrator has strong personal reasons for pointing out a detailed physical description if they don't have that i found a lot of authors just tone it back or throw in a few features every so often throughout the book where they fit this is why suzanne collins basically only gives us one feature of katniss in her introduction her braid she didn't have a reason to give much else and just threw other things in along the way later on that wasn't that important you don't need a big complex reason to describe something no but it is worth recognizing when a character wouldn't give a slew of details like this and this is why as much as i love john green i actually think his description of miles and looking for alaska is lacking he seems to draw a connection between miles's desire to find a great perhaps and this physical description as the dribbling shower slowly soaked my body i wondered whether i could find a grade perhaps here at all or whether i had made a grand miscalculation but i couldn't quite decipher what that connection is it doesn't seem to inform their desire or communicate this struggle with the great perhaps making this description feel kind of forced just for the benefit of the reader but i also found a huge number of descriptions did more than just talk about the character they part four tell us about everything around them this could mean their relationships the setting or even theme in a few cases i actually just finished margaret atwood's the testaments and i was astounded with the finesse with how she somehow opened her book with a character description that gripped me only the dead are allowed to have statues but i had been given one while still alive already i am petrified this statue was a small token of appreciation for my many contributions said the citation we don't do cheering here in ardua hall but there was discreet clapping i inclined my head in a nod my statue is larger than life as statues tend to be and shows me as younger slimmer and in better shape than i've been for some time i am standing straight shoulders back my lips curved into a firm but benevolent smile my eyes are fixed on some cosmic point of reference understood to represent my idealism my unflinching commitment to duty my determination to move forward despite all obstacles it gives us a physical description by drawing connections between how she looks and how those looks fit in with the principles of gilead society in other words she's setting the scene and atmosphere and world building this dim reality this is a restrictive world of unflinching duty and order before kindness this contrast between her and her statue also introduces a core element of the novel the difference between how she is perceived publicly and how she truly thinks in a short story winnow henley kidder uses a description to talk about how two girls have each changed after their breakup her hair has grown a lot almost to her hips there's the half moon scar she's paler than she was last i saw her too not sickly looking just not as sunned it makes her green eyes stand out when i'm not tan you can see the blue veins running beneath my skin and dark circles under my eyes i look like that now she looks porcelain her eyelashes flutter as she takes in the room eyes landing on me she glides over unrushed and graceful she must have been in the shop for a while because her arms feel warm through both our long sleeves the perspective character here lingers on details from memory like the half moon scar and dwells on her warmth it's a little awkward because there's this distinct sense of longing from one side kidd also uses juxtaposition as a technique here with the girl's eyes to show that one has it together and the other one doesn't how she describes doesn't just show us what these girls look like but how they've each changed since their relationship i also want to give you two weirder examples of character descriptions that are used to develop theme or concept trnapp is a strange loop and patrick and this is the rest of us just live here he had a full head of silver hair that probably wasn't real and a movie star chin that most definitely wasn't the gold of the heavy chain around his wrist that would be real the doctor looked 40 but he stank of money probably closer to 60. the doctor gave him the perfect imitation of a smile his pristine white teeth matching the room a strange loop deals with to what degree a person is real or authentic in a world where you can sell or get rid of memories there's a terrible irony to him describing the doctor this way he sees the man as fake like society often does with these sorts of things but he does not realize he is becoming less real himself by selling his memories to this corporation in this story nappa does something quite clever here he connects his theme to his main character's arc and world view which affects how he describes others which features he focuses on like the fake hair and fake smile as the character slowly realizes what he is losing and becoming as he sells his memories across the story so how the mc describes others really does play into the thematic discussion of whether someone is real or authentic or fake and this also intersects with content selection what you choose to put in your story because i'm sure nappa actually designed that doctor to look fake it's not just a bias and how a character describes him so you're not just thinking about how a character describing someone else can intersect with theme but how physical appearance itself can intersect with theme the second example is really weird because nist doesn't actually describe his main characters basically at all and that's kind of the point the gimmick of the story is that it's not really about the characters you would consider the main characters they're the npcs in the background there's actually this secondary story about the quote indie kids who he does describe in detail but the characters that the story is actually about well their ordinariness is meant to be so pervasive that i think he was like well they're not really warranting much description at all if you want a connect description to setting or world building consider connecting a character's features to social norms laws principles and beliefs that impact the character comparison and juxtaposition are great techniques for building relationships through description theme can come through in description when a character's biases and arc come from a discussion of that theme and with all of this i think that it's worth us looking at some part five structural techniques things that might just help us pin down some more sentence to sentence stuff as to why these descriptions are so effective an interesting one was used by stein glassen in the girl with the dragon tattoo for some reason his description of cylander was so memorable to me and i think i might know why it's what i'm going to be calling the whiplash effect because it kind of gives you that larson first gives a several page rundown of solanda's meticulous reporting and record keeping before he ever describes her physically but that detailed description of her meticulous agonizingly hard-working no-nonsense work ethic leads you to imagine an uptight pantsuit fbi agent type before he turns the tables on you and describes her suddenly as a pale anorexic young woman who had hair as short as a fuse and a pierced nose and eyebrows she had a wasp tattoo about an inch long on her neck as though she had just emerged from a week-long orgy with a gang of hard rockers her movements were quick and spidery why does this work well i think it might be kind of like how delivery exposition is more memorable if the characters were fully mistaken about something first and then the truth is revealed and that drastic shift in framing makes it more memorable it's whiplash by describing characteristics that really contrast with the reader's expectations of what they might look like the reveal of their physical description can become a lot more memorable a gentle man with massive muscles a librarian drag queen a really shy boy who towers over you i've already mentioned a second technique juxtaposition where you put two contrasting features alongside one another to help them both stand out like hannah lee kidder did with those eyes of the two girls in wino you can juxtapose different characters when comparing just to those different parts of the same character's body or juxtapose their body with theme or world or personality the options are endless and the end result is making it more memorable a third is highlighting a special characteristic in its own sentence harry had a thin face knobby knees black hair and bright green eyes he wore round glasses held together with a lot of scotch tape because of all the times dudley had punched him on the nose the only thing harry liked about his own appearance was a very thin scar on his forehead that was shaped like a bolt of lightning rolling signals to the reader here that the scar will be of some narrative importance by separating it out in its own sentence helping the reader form the image of him around it and she actually does this exact same structural thing in the chamber of secrets as well she knows how this works things in a list like this can blur in the reader's mind so if there is a feature that you want them to remember then perhaps give it its own sentence or paragraph or use stronger words to emphasize it above other features i found this was relatively common in a lot of descriptions fourthly i noticed a pattern in fast-paced scenes that used physical description movement posture facial expressions tend to be more contextually relevant to the scene at hand than your eyes your hands your curvaceous hips ready for childbearing when things are moving quickly movement posture and body shape tend to be more relevant to the action whereas things like hair and eyes can kill the pacing if you just step apart from the story to talk about them not always mind you but you've got to keep asking what's relevant to the scene at hand especially when you're trying to keep the pace up let's consider how antonio iturb introduces hirsch in the fast-paced opening to the librarian of auschwitz but hersh would smile he was always smiling enigmatically as if he knew something that no one else did his eyes are locked on him his nod is barely perceptible hirsch emerges from his tiny cubicle pretending to be pleasantly surprised by the visit of the ss guards hirsch remains upright the more they relax their posture the more erect he'll be to demonstrate the strength of the jews antonia itube characterizes hirosh as an unshakable weary but warm-faced smiling but firm straight-backed man through his movement expression and posture because they play into the scene at hand they are simply more relevant he's simultaneously showing the interaction with the ss guards and what it means for the characters in the story but i want to take a step back and talk about something you might not have noticed just how few features are often physically described like some of them only have one or two and that's by the way not to say that you should only describe one or two i'm just trying to get it that you don't need to feel compelled to paint a perfect picture i mean none of these guys did and i think that's because these guys understood that they're not just describing characters for the sake of describing characters that what they're doing is letting the reader get to know their characters and sometimes physical description just doesn't factor into that hell agency doesn't give any physical description of the main perspective character of the opening chapter who's also a main character later in the novel at all he entirely describes her through her thought patterns and speech patterns and it works because those are the best things to indicate her character what really came through in all this is that we have to remember we're not just describing characters we are introducing characters and how you do this will be totally dependent on your personal style and taste as well part six my writing okay nervous um i actually learned a lot from researching this video i went back and i looked at the character descriptions in my novel and i found that they were somewhat lacking so i've never done this before because i'm pretty private about my writing but i want to show you a character description from my novel before i made the changes and what it looks like afterwards with the tips and discussion from this video i will not be revealing the title i have changed the names but this is a piece from the novel that i hope to publish this is the description before the changes her motley tweed jacket said everything you needed to know about her it was held together a little haphazardly all her own patchwork ever won to fix something herself old and wearing its age with pride her keys slacked around a larger ring as she walked the kind you hear rattle before you're told it's time to go from the dungeon to the blocks and this well this is after i made some changes learning some stuff from researching this video her tweed jacket said everything you need to know about her a haphazard patchwork of spite and unorthodoxy it wore its age with pride and seams sewn and race zone times over her keys slacked around a large ring as she strode a giant shorter than me it was the rattle you hear before you're told it's time to walk from the dungeon to the blocks in both versions i use that limper and eye patch technique by focusing on a particular feature her jacket that distinguishes her from other characters the story is also told from a first person perspective so i wanted to add in a line that uses my perspective character's biases they very much admire and respect this woman so they would characterize her as a giant despite her height i also really wanted to strengthen the words and verbs that i used strode is much more visceral than walked and it communicates something of the woman's confidence so yeah i think that this new description tells us more about who she is and it does more showing rather than telling now and i also want to read to you a short piece that i am kind of proud of looking back after this video alice needed my help up the slope i gripped at her forearm and she mine and her chestnut skin felt like memories caused in the palms from handiwork while the rest was driftwood warped in shade and texture by acid burns from our experiments they were battle scars always on display basically i'm trying to show you how i'm using my research to improve my writing as well partly because it's good too i want to get more used to showing my writing publicly but also because i get pretty freaked out by the standard that people are going to hold my writing to coming out of all of this it's pretty scary sometimes and i want to show you that i am also always trying to improve my writing as well as i said at the beginning i studied over 30 great character descriptions for this video but we only covered a handful of these today and uh if you want the extra analysis that i put together then it's available to all patrons it's got extra analysis on all of these books as well as books that we didn't get to cover today and some of the best analysis i feel links are all down in the description below if you want to support me and get access to all this but summary time one vivid character descriptions often highlight one or a few distinguishing physical features sometimes contrasting it with the same feature in other characters vivid descriptions are careful with word choice rather than stating facts they use words that give extra connotations that also describe the character two posture movement and facial expressions can be even more important to physical description than hair eyes or body shape they are often more useful in fast-paced scenes where characters are introduced three the best physical descriptions tell us about who the characters are their psychological state their flaws their worldview their personality their thought patterns and more consider not just your character's distinct visual features but features that come from those quirks those flaws strengths struggles and beliefs four the bias of the perspective character can impact how others or themselves are described and characterize the narrator in doing so consider how your character's feelings affect how they describe something especially in first person or third person limited fifthly character descriptions can also tell us about the story around them relationship setting world building or even theme this is often through juxtaposition and comparison the characters arc may shape what they focus on in others at the start and end of the story and sex some structural techniques include the whiplash effect juxtaposition and highlighting a special characteristic in its own sentence but that's all from me man i love doing these more technique focused videos let me know what you guys want to see more of in the future down below check out that patreon stuff in the meantime stay nerdy and i will see you in the future you\n",

      "killing people is fun isn't it it feels great when you pull off a good death scene people cry you're a good writer because you made people feel something which you know is hard these days so i've been studying 19 death scenes by brilliant authors across multiple genres why they work and what specific techniques we can learn from them and i got in an expert hi i'm sean bean and i'll even show you a death scene that i wrote they're gonna hate it oh no it's terrible oh my god what if i'm a fail and because i don't want you mad at me spoilers okay for all of these things we're talking character deaths you've been warned this type of video takes a lot of time for me to read study and write so thanks to the writing world building program campfire for sponsoring the video and helping make it possible and you know what you can help the channel and get 20 off that's right 20 off with my code down below and my last video like this on writing character descriptions got to be honest started out really terribly but once people started commenting liking sharing etc it literally saved the video i hate to be that guy but it really does help part one the language you use matters now you already know that if the reader is invested in a character it's gonna hurt when they die no matter how except get readers invested in your character isn't that helpful advice that's kind of all of writing isn't it but what you focus on and your word choice when describing them dying will create different feelings for the reader focusing on visceral bodily descriptors like the snap of bones breaking and specific bodily trauma creates fear and horror in the reader unsurprisingly it's a hallmark of stephen king's writing and then as he entered the zone of broken glass he felt her hand close around his left ankle and squeeze his stump excruciatingly he screamed one of his elbows came down on a hook of glass and it jabbed up into his arm he crawled forward anyway with it sticking out of him like a push pin he turned back again and yes her face had gone black a dusky rotted plum black from which her bleeding eyes bulged wildly the pressure slackened for a moment he could breathe again then annie collapsed on top of him a mountain of slack flesh and he couldn't breathe at all king's focus is on these clear instinctual descriptions of injuries and pain that create this claustrophobic feeling with a real threat of harm that we can understand very physically to the point that we're left with a sigh of relief when it's over and we can contrast this with how philip pullman describes lee scorsby's death and his dart materials another crack and this time the bullet went deep somewhere inside seeking out the center of his life he thought it won't find it there hester's my center lee found it hard to pull the trigger everything was hard then she was pressing her little proud broken self against his face as close as she could get and then they died the language here talks about pain and death in the abstract rather than attaching it to visceral bodily descriptors like king where pullman uses metaphors and similes to abstract us from the pain of death focusing instead on the love that he and his daemon hester shared king's only poetics only bring us closer to the painful and uncomfortable experience with words like slack flesh the word choice in the subtle knife helps the reader feel sorrow and loss not uncomfortable or horrified the way king wants us to feel he could have described the intense agony of having a bullet inside you but he doesn't consider where the words put the focus and the description of your death scene and also how abstracted the reader is from the characters pain and suffering but this is also why you've gotta think really carefully about part two how you introduce the death so um i read british terabithia when i was like 10 a great age to read a book like that and uh it's about two kids who bond over an imaginary magical land together who would have guessed i'd love it and the ending is really tight like a rope that will never snap both it and john green's looking for alaska are books that deal with the unfair suddenness of death with denial and unresolved grief and they do it in similar ways so let's look at how they introduce the death to do that he watched the car go out of sight the joy giggling inside of him so hard that he wouldn't have been surprised if his feet had just taken off from the ground the way they sometimes did in dreams and floated him right over the roof he was all the way into the kitchen before he realized that something was wrong his dad's pickup hadn't been outside the door but he hadn't taken it in until he came into the room and found them all sitting there his parents and the little girls at the kitchen table and ellie and brenda on the couch not eating there was no food on the table not watching tv it wasn't even turned on he stood unmoving for a second while they stared at him suddenly his mother let out a great shuddering sob oh my god oh my god she said it over and over her head down on her arms his father moved to put his arm around her awkwardly but he didn't take his eyes off jess i told you he just got off somewhere maybelles said quietly and stubbornly as though she had repeated it often and no one had believed her brenda's pouting voice broke in your girlfriend's dead and mama thought you was dead too she just kills a kid like that my crush when i was 10 just gone dead i'm fine great book firstly there's no explanation or gradually leaning into the death it's just your girlfriend's dead very suddenly in the sentence almost unkindly suddenly they phrase it in this cold and very factual way secondly they both offer the reader an alternative explanation for why everyone is looking so worried to lure the reader into a false sense of security before revealing the truth this gives us momentary relief hope which then makes the reveal all the more shocking and sharper thirdly they both put it at a point in the narrative structure where the reader has kind of been promised that their character still has stuff to do and at a point that we don't usually expect this kind of death they also both purposely place the death off screen to work against that assumption that we'll be able to be there to have a proper goodbye to deprive us of that catharsis especially because in fiction we have this underlying logic that if a main character dies then we'll be there to see it but we aren't but death does not wait it also sets the story up to explore feelings of denial and dread leading up to the reveal as the clues slowly stack up for us and the guilt of not being there for them after these may be feelings that you want the reader to have and these can help you do that off-screen deaths can also happen for other reasons too suspense or it's inappropriate for your style or genre or age group or you want their final moment to be something else perhaps maybe a father is on a trip with his son in the arctic and they're running out of food and to ensure his son survives he goes out into the cold to die the important moment here is the goodbye and not the death the son not seeing the death is even important in contrast we can look at how the death of the tenth doctor from doctor who is introduced to us which i have not and will not get over because we all damn well know it peaked with him if you disagree with me feel free to tell me why you're wrong in the comments ten's death is introduced very gradually we can see it coming for a long time and it's 20 minutes from knowing he will die to dead it's not a gruesome slog of him bleeding out on the ground either the writer didn't want to create the feelings of horror and fear like stephen king or shock and loss like bridge to terabithia or looking for alaska he wanted us to feel the sorrow that comes from the inevitability of knowing your death is coming and not being able to stop it culminating in this final moment i don't want to go this is a feeling a lot of stories about terminally ill characters trying to create in the reader and in both cases that time before the death is really important to fostering that feeling but sometimes character deaths can be dragged out to help the reader come to terms with their death accept it eventually move on with this bittersweet ending gladiator ends with the death of maximus and you can see it coming for a long time with him seeing his family in the afterlife in these flashes where bridge to terabithia's suddenness feels horrible because there was never any chance to say goodbye or come to terms with it by the time maximus actually dies there's this catharsis for the viewer that he's finally at rest especially because those last moments are spent killing the antagonist his whole story is tied up for us there's also no sudden tonal shift in this moment either like there are in the stories of looking for alaska and bridge to terabithia because the writers wanted the death to feel like a natural passage for the character and this story we are being told to let him go it's not jarring in any way it's just the next step you as the author can use a drawn out death scene to make it easier or harder to accept the death by guiding the reader with how the characters are reacting to it in stories about how to face death for both the reader and character that time before death is precious but as i studied these i realized that basically all of them use this literary technique to heighten the emotions of their death scenes they use part three juxtaposition placing two contrasting things right next to one another to elevate their differences bridge to tirabithia makes a point of describing just how happy jess is things are going great right before he learns of leslie's death and similarly looking for alaska has miles ecstatic thinking about how he's just begun to kiss alaska this girl of his dreams all to make that sudden tonal drop more drastic and the pain more sudden because there's this whiplash against that recently uplifting emotion i want to show you how it's used in this really sweet short story called two robots at the end of the world which is about two robots at the end of the world called motherboard and toaster a burning tide was washing over the horizon it glittered with memory its many arms propping itself up on the mountaintops four percent toaster had seen many images of humans watching the sunrise and sunset one of them had always rested their head on the shoulder of the other he had no head and motherboard had no shoulder but he wheeled himself up onto the rock at her level and tipped his optic screen onto her bonnet it was growing colder remember to keep your solar plates open toaster she said her audio chip fuzzing out on the last few words clinging to the sunrise motherboard used what little power she had left to sear the fire and bronze display onto her optics it was the last thing she would ever see a sunrise that would stay with her forever crystallized not bent or refracted every strand captured perfectly her optics dipped motherboard said toaster but he was alone and that was written by me actually i didn't want to shape your expectations of it by telling you first juxtaposing motherboard's death with a beautiful sunrise just serves to emphasize the grim reality of her death in a way that simply describing how horrible and dark and fearful and painful it is now would not juxtaposition like this also complicates your prose in a death scene beauty in dark times can hold a lot of meaning for characters and the reader like it does for toaster here it's intentionally bittersweet and it's something motherboard always wanted to see but gladiator on the other hand actually uses juxtaposition to help us come to terms with maximus death and let him go the final scenes flick and contrast between the bloody dry arena and the beautiful tranquil fields of the afterlife the beauty of the next life only makes the bloody reality of this one worse as the scene goes on you want him to move on to this beautiful place until he does and it feels right so the question is what small thing could you juxtapose the death against in your prose to enhance the emotions or atmosphere that you want your reader to feel death scenes mean you're handling a lot of complicated emotions you really want the reader to feel something and when you want that it can be really easy to fall into part four mellow drama this is funny this is not this funny this not funny not when you really want the reader to feel something there's this very real temptation to just ramp up the intensity and displays of emotion falling to their knees crying to the heavens fainting in shock going i have been guilty of this and chances are so have you and it's especially tempting when killing a character we want readers to feel things but melodrama isn't that great these days melodrama strips a scene of subtext which is when there's information not explicitly said but it plays into the scene depth in other words look what's being felt and explored but isn't being said aloud in the scene it's also just not convincing for characters to be over dramatic in these ways which can at worst make it funny in your most emotional moments but it's also just not that immersive because we're being told how to feel rather than just letting ourselves feel the moment as it is the reality is humans will often have a lot going on inside their head even if it doesn't come out in these big displays physically or vocally this simple handshake between john coffey and paul edgecombe as he puts this innocent man to death is a hell of a lot more meaningful to me than even though the handshake is very underplayed restraint and what we don't say are also fantastic indications of emotions and character so are you being melodramatic with your death scene well i think there are four main red flags that are easy to look out for one characters are expressing emotions disproportionate to their death or to how they would usually express themselves especially physically it's out of character but the story treats it as totally authentic two characters are expressing everything that they're feeling vocally stay with me oh it's getting dark cliches often come to mind about this three characters are describing just how freaking intense an emotion is rather than what it means for them or describing how they're reacting and four excessive use of metaphors or extended metaphors to describe the feelings and cheers to shailene bishop theonix and chris winkle who pointed out the last couple of those that i hadn't thought of and for a great example let's return to the instant classic fifty shades of grey the pain is indescribable physical mental metaphysical it is everywhere seeping into the marrow of my bones grief this is grief and i brought it on myself deep down and nasty unbidden thought comes from my inner goddess her lips contorted a snarl the physical pain from the bite of a belt is nothing nothing compared to this devastation existential pain or relief or loss after someone's death is a thing but people don't tend to think of it in these abstract ways but in how we can't get out of bed how we feel nothing when we're doing something we would usually love how we can't focus on damn well anything i'm not saying using metaphors to describe emotions is melodramatic on its own it's not but having them dominate how a character expresses their emotions especially metaphors that are esoteric and heady and philosophical can make a death feel like it's not really happening in or affecting reality we can immediately contrast this to miles reaction to alaska's death in looking for alaska gasping vomiting over and over again wanting to melt into the brown crunchy grass a dull endless pain in my gut that wouldn't go away even when i knelt on the stingingly frozen tile of the bathroom dry heaving very little is abstract here and even when it is it's all grounded in very relatable actions and decisions this is where you need to listen to beta readers if they tell you it's melodramatic it's probably because it's coming across that way but it also may mean that you haven't built up the important story beats the way that you think and so readers might just not be convinced of the intensity of these emotions yet and that's because as authors it is very easy for us to feel what we think people should be feeling when we're reading our own writing but i also found that the most heart-wrenching deaths for me went even further than this because they part five leave the character with something unfinished a goal they haven't reached a conversation they need to have a place they need to see an arc they haven't finished something important they need to do and it especially hurts if they're really close to it this does two things one it's hard to come to terms with their death when we don't get the catharsis we feel we deserve when their subplots and arcs aren't neatly tied up yet and two it makes it more unexpected for the same reasons we kind of expect everything to be tied up before a character can die jon snow's death in george r martin's dance with dragons hit when it came out because jon still hadn't learned the truth of his parents beaten the others or fully earned the loyalty of the night's watch as leader john green captures this feeling quite nicely in alaska's unexplored relationship with miles as he thinks don't i have just begun to kiss her in bridge to terabithia they still have to save the imaginary kingdom together when she dies the tenth doctor's whole thing was that he felt like he could do so much more if he didn't die i consistently found that the most painful deaths for me left me with these unresolved feelings of something left unfinished that deprived me of the catharsis i thought the character deserved and i deserved we talked before about sudden vs expected deaths and leaving something unfinished can really help capture that sense of the suddenness of death that death doesn't wait for us to tie up all of our plot lines on the other hand you could complicate the reader's feelings about a character's death by having them willing to die but some things are still unfinished the reader can feel that catharsis but there's also that element of unfairness snape kind of fits into this he dies in the deathly hallows knowing he is protecting harry and that harry knows that he was predicting him but he never gets to see voldemort's fall a final revenge for lily that he always wanted but at the same time we kind of love stories where characters are finished before they die like in gladiator we like fiction with that kind of security that nice ending in a way it's part of that escapism even if it's heartbreaking in a different way it's sad because they're dying yeah but it's also a happy ending in a twisted way because we don't have this unresolved tension with them especially if they chose to die heroically sacrificing their life it's bittersweet it gives us hope that people can change and death won't get in the way i mean is anything more of a red flag that a character is about to [Â __Â ] it than them going ah i'm so glad that my character arc is done hey i can't wait to retire to that farm up north like we always said we would anyways i'm gonna go fight the bad guys now i'll see you in a couple of days yeah he's already dead but things don't have to be unexpected to be good or write game of thrones but it's a different experience for the reader and you gotta know what experience you want the reader to have do you want them feeling unresolved accepting it sad but understanding or somewhere in between and if you want to make it even more heartbreaking and i mean at this point we're nick deep in depression you can add an element of part six injustice or unfairness they didn't deserve it it's just pointless suffering it was inevitable they were just in the wrong place at the wrong time and it was at this point in writing the script that i realized that the death that impacted me the most was probably donna noble from doctor who technically she doesn't die but she does lose all of her memories and the person she has grown to become it's functionally death of the character we know what made it so heartbreaking was that donna began as someone who saw herself as worthless and unremarkable but had grown over the story and her self-esteem to see herself as capable someone of value more than anyone she'd deserve to keep her experiences of being with the doctor but she got this horrible ending and again you know this has been doctor who peaked this is not up for debate injustice or unfairness creates a different kind of empathy in the reader but it can also create a resentment or hatred against the character who causes their death in the way that say two equally skilled opponents dueling it out might not and that might be valuable to you as a writer could be the spark of a vengeance quest or a descent into madness and that's because the truth is that death scenes aren't really just about the character that dies they're about part seven how it affects the people around them in both the case of something being left unfinished or injustice and unfairness these have consequences for the remaining characters now one of the pieces that you will usually come across when looking at death scenes is that death should have a second purpose in the narrative and i mostly agree with this unfinished plot threads are a great way to do that because the remaining characters have to deal with the holes left behind by this character when ned stark died in the game of thrones he had promised to tell jon his true parentage and jon is left grappling with the idea that he might never know nid's goal was to protect his family from the lannisters and so that job falls to rob stark who in response calls himself the king in the north it gives narrative weight and meaningful consequences to their death rather than just being a thing that happened it can even sometimes give catharsis in the long term as characters filled those holes left behind or get justice where the character couldn't and pixar's up ellie fredrickson always wanted to see paradise falls but died before she ever could so carl does this by the end of the film and there's a catharsis to that then he finally fulfilled her dream so you can use unfinished plot threads to control the reader's experience and give the death more purpose and meaning and that unfairness or injustice can also come from how it affects the characters around them some people also say that you need to know a character really well to care about them dying but hot take i don't think that's really true a character who we don't know well dying can still mean a lot if we know what that person represents to another character in what remains of myasenkovy by gdanjia and ai is tasked to be the mother of human children on a new planet we don't know that much about their first child daisy but we do know what successfully bringing this first child into the world means to the ai we see daisy's dandelion head pop up and down on the waves she's unconscious a small speck in a sea of rust and scarlet we feel the heat of our components and see the warnings emerge in our field of vision we fight against the waves against the errors they swallow daisy pull her little body under we dive bump into a sharp stone with our knee before our hands grab daisy's shoulder we lay her down stretch her neck give cpr and pump air into her lungs three rounds three terrible new memories then daisy convulses spews out the water she swallowed only a little bit of dying today we cry out we hug her whisper her name against her hair tell her we love her so so much stupid child we say but we do not mean it daisy shakes and we cry without tears her firstborn her purpose everything she hopes to be and it's unfair it hurts when she dies later in the story the point is a great death scene is made by what surrounds it as well what we can call the scaffolding of the scene but we need to bring this back to something a lot of less experienced writers grapple with because a lot of us just assume that death is the end goal but the truth is part 8 there are fates better than death there are so many things worse than death that can happen to your characters i can't just default to it because i think that's the only way to move a story forward or because i want the reader to feel lost when i say fates better than death i mean better for your story death is a tool but it's not necessarily the most meaningful most impactful not even most painful end you can give a character donna losing her memories is proof enough it's more meaningful and more painful than simply dying because she loses all of that character growth through no fault of her own only you can figure out the most meaningful into your character's story but there are some tools that i use to help figure these out personally i am a big fan of literary symmetry for example let's contrast ned stark's death in the game of thrones with iro's survival in the last airbender ned stark's death is not literary symmetry but it was perhaps the most meaningful way to end his story it wove into the underlying machiavellian philosophy of the series that traditionally heroic traits are no guarantees of success which is why varys explains to ned it was not the wine that killed the king it was your mercy his mercy his virtue in the end gets him killed and he's the perfect character to establish that anyone in this story can die in contrast ira was once a warmongering nationalist who laid siege to passing save for the fire nation now he could have died saving zuko and that would have been meaningful in its own way but the writers chose a kind of literary symmetry by having his story culminate in him saving sing save from the fire nation instead going from warmonger to peacekeeper there's a literary symmetry here that gives his arc a sense of completeness that it's come full circle and literary symmetry is comically common with villain deaths i mean harry survived voldemort in the first book because of his mother's loving willing sacrifice for him and then in the seventh book he's suddenly shocked that everyone is protected from voldemort because harry's loving willing sacrifice for his friends you can draw a lot of tension from things that aren't the threat of death so if you're looking for another more meaningful into a character look at their fears their weaknesses an end that would contrast with their arc across the story and this is especially relevant for characters that you and the reader know will not die you know the sword i'm talking about nobody thinks the doctor will ever permanently die companions sure they're a dime a dozen these days but for him it's just not on the cards so the high points of the show for me have always been when they threaten him with fates worse than death losing his memories his personality losing the people around him losing his morality these all take account of his deepest struggles and weaknesses and turn them on their head whether you want a character to meet a painful or good ending think about literary symmetry and fates that interact with their weaknesses strengths their arc and fears redemption arc sometimes come up here with the now good guy sacrificing his life and personally i don't like that i don't think it's really redemption to just die ah oh wow man look at all those bad things i did i'm cocking it now when it's much more meaningful to face up to the wrongs of your past but also don't go too hard on yourself with any of this don't feel like you have to obey all of these esoteric writing rules if you feel like your character's story naturally ends in death or you just want to write to their story that way do it it's your story don't listen to anyone else and you'll still make people cry have fun with it i try to only take sponsors that i really do feel you guys might genuinely find helpful and campfire is a really good writing and worldbuilding program too okay so i was gonna do a normal sponsor section but then i put out a tweet saying hey you know when you write a name or a place or a magic system term in your book and it comes up with that little red squiggly line that says hey this is spelled in correctly and you can't get rid of it it keeps happening you know it gets really annoying so i said hey wouldn't it be great if when you go add to dictionary you can add your own definition and have like a glossary for all the terms you've added for that document and transplant it into other documents like other chapters as well and i take campfire saying hey can you do this and they said mission accepted not even kidding 16 hours flat that added that to campfire that is the sort of people that we're dealing with not even to say all of the other features the campfire already has pages for writing and word building and places and magic systems etc i was just really impressed that they did that so yeah that is the sort of product that people at campfire are making they listen and they've done it well so when i say that they're good i mean it they really do deserve the success that they're having and i can get totally behind it and you get 20 off with my code and you only pay what you want for what you're gonna use i really like that and so does momo do you doubt momo but let's bring all of this together in a thick milky pot firstly visceral bodily descriptors can create fear and horror in a death scene making the reader uncomfortable while more abstract language allows us to focus on other feelings like sorrow and love rather than very real pain secondly suddenly introducing death or placing it off screen helps the reader explore the unfair abruptness of death and feelings of unresolved grief alternative explanations can lure the reader into a false sense of security and make that reveal more impactful thirdly longer death scenes can foster an exploration of powerlessness and the inevitability of death but they can also be used to guide the reader to accepting this bittersweet ending fourthly juxtaposition can add depth to your prose and make a character's death easier or harder to accept especially if it creates tonal whiplash fifthly melodrama strips the scene of subtext it's usually less convincing and immersive and it's often the result of trying to get a reader to feel something by ramping up the intensity of the emotions it's often marked by disproportionate reactions cliches excessive metaphors and describing feelings in the abstract sixthly leaving the characters with something unfinished or making the death unjust or unfair is a great way to make a death more unexpected and deprive the reader of that catharsis unfinished plot threads are also a great way to give the death a second purpose and seventhly consider what might be the most meaningful fate for your character taking account of their arc their fears their strengths and literary symmetry this was a lot of fun if you want to share a death scene you wrote down in the comments below i'd love to read them stay nerdy guys and i will see you in the future [Music] foreign\n",

already you know what's even better than volume one volume two electric boogaloo and it's out now link below this book is a codified version of all of the writing world building discussions we've had since volume one so that's fight scenes and creating world histories and flashbacks and redemption arcs all of that all brand new stuff but not only is this way easier to study and reference than a bunch of videos is but it's been rewritten and refined with over 12 000 words worth of exclusive extra detail and depth just in here just way more examples way more analysis packed into this if you have found my work like today's video helpful at all then this is the way to support it links down below to the paperback and ebook and the audiobook is coming really damn soon you can buy it from amazon but if you hate amazon fare you can buy it from a bunch of other places as well and hopefully your local bookstore you guys picked this cover and didn't it just turned out freaking stunning i am in love with it what's that you say what do you mean it would make a fantastic christmas present right now oh who would have thought of that part one dialogue tags versus action tags well jim james professor we're not going to use magic ron ejaculated loudly snap ejaculated slughorn understanding how to use dialogue tags is one of the easiest ways to improve the flow and sound of your dialogue let's have a look at how need forzini handles a conversation between a lot of people in its kind of a funny story a boy his mother a doctor a nurse and a policeman i know i hold her back mrs gilner she really needs to leave with the dog the nurse says she has a dog dogs are against policy chris says just one second dr mahmoud says we all look at him all right mrs gilner since you're here your son has checked himself in due to suicidal litigation and acute depression you understand yes he was on a zoloft but he stopped taking it you did mum turns to me i thought i was better i shrug stubborn like your father yes doctor well the next question is for craig craig would you like to be admitted yes i say fazzini uses four dialogue tags all said or say but also replaces some dialogue tags with action tags i hold her back and mom turns to me these tell us who said the line and give a bit of movement and variety to the scene action tags can be really great replacements here the action tags develop the important dynamics that craig is uncomfortable with his mother's overbearingness and his mum's shock at him stopping his medication action tags also allow you to control the pacing a bit if you want to slow an exchange down or have the reader focus on one particular line then having the characters move to a chair or close the door behind them or clean their glasses is a way to do that give gravitas to a moment action beats can also help indicate the cadence or pacing of the line to follow as well yes yes of course yes sydney waved his hands urgently that's how i worked out this one reverse thermaturgy yes certainly uh in time sydney waving his hands means that we read this line as someone speaking perhaps a little bit louder faster more desperately that can help you show rather than tell but as always there's a butt use them too much and it turns into this just one second dr mamo checked his notebook we all looked to him all right mrs gilner you understand your son has checked himself in he opened the window to let in some fresh air yes his mother nodded anxiously mr marmot sat down at his desk he was on a zoloft but he stopped taking it do you see how clunky that is here the characters are doing things but they don't really mean anything it adds variety yeah but the dialogue is slow like it's constantly stopping and starting easily one of the most common pieces of advice i end up giving to people is to cut these action tags that don't really mean anything and just to let their characters talk that too many action tags just lose their effect so when working action tags into your dialogue maybe look for a few of those more important lines that develop the dynamics in your scene where the scene ramps up in tension or where something changes you can even slip them into the middle of a line with em dashes in between to create a sense that someone is doing something at the same time as they are speaking but what about dialogue tags sid shouted burst cried growled ejaculated oh that was written in one of the highest selling books of all time twice 1. sid is the most important dialogue tag you have and you're gonna be using it a hell of a lot more than all of the rest of them and here is why when we look at how set is used and it's kind of a funny story you can see it's mostly used for clarity when characters are conversing in quick succession when there's a lot of them marking when new characters jump in sid isn't really telling us how they are talking exactly just who is talking it operates more like grammar to speech than words that you actually read two people advise against using said bugisms like yelled and swore and growled because the word said encompasses a lot of the different ways that we say things now that's why i answered and replied and queried and commented so often read clunky they're placeholder dialogue tags easy words that you can cut or replace because they're doing the same thing as said but uh just worse and they get the reader to snag on what you really mean we infer how things are said from the context the dialogue itself and grammar like an exclamation mark because of this characters who are constantly chirping and growling and nuttering can sound melodramatic one of the easy tells is that i'll be reading dialogue and i won't really believe it because these words are indicating that the lines are being said with way more intensity than the author probably intends and then there's three sometimes what you're trying to do is better accomplished with an action tag for example please just let them go take me instead graham begged versus please just let them go take me instead graham moved between the officer and the door tears and his eyes it's just so much stronger isn't it but the question remains does it not when do you use these fancy words like murmured and swore and ejaculated the answer is never never use ejaculated but no they are still very useful for a rough idea i went through the first 100 dialogue tags of stephen king's the mist and brandon stannison's mistborn both of whom are prolific modern authors and i found that about 10 to 15 of their tags were other words though i do want to mention that a lot of those were asked and when i went back to my book and had a look i found that i had about 30 which is probably a bit too high so i cut those back and it was a really easy way to improve my dialogue one of the ways you can use these other dialogue tags is to give information that's not immediately apparent in the dialogue itself she started to sniffle again and he put a fatherly arm around her she pulled in close trying to use his warmth to push away the pain i loved him calcium she whispered elend i know whispered is just one of those sorts of words it's just clarifying the tone this passage from the girl with the dragon tattoo shows us another way to use these other tags larson uses the word gasped to mark a change in gear in the scene up until this point the two characters have just been going back and forth using the word said until here where the character blankfest enrages the serial killer the same thing happens a couple of pages later when the tension ramps up again with the arrival of salinder no run he croaked here these other words are being used to mark the tension ramping up or down but i've also seen these words used a lot to mark an emotional shift in the scene from anger to sadness or sadness to happiness or neutral to some other emotion but sometimes they're just a shorthand way of indicating intensity or cadence or sarcasm or emotion or contrasting two characters when you don't want to spend too many words on it and that's okay show don't tell is a generally helpful if nebulous tip but when it comes to dialogue tags not everything can or should come out in posture and expression and constant action tags can be really grating and tedious sometimes showing with these words is just more efficient and this is easily the most common reason people use these words now it's going to take practice to figure out where that line is for your work i can't tell you exactly but it's like salt a little helps but you don't want it to only taste of salt and speaking of things that i am salty about part two let your damn characters talk i read pieces all the time where the author just refuses to let characters talk more than a couple of lines at a time without a tag or prose or an action beat and it is so annoying once vazini establishes that it's dr mahmoud and mrs gilner speaking they go back and forth for a couple of lines no dialogue no action tags at all some people are afraid to do this because i don't know they think the reader won't be able to follow or that they need action for the scene to be interesting but that is just not the case please in the northern lights philip pullman has lyra and the professor going back and forth for three pages with only five dialogue tags and only two real action tags the girl with the dragon tattoo has 500 words at a time with only a couple in the mix that's because they trust me to follow what's happening and they let me get immersed in the dialogue and i love that constantly interrupting makes it slow and takes me out of the conversation so hear me out a really easy way to improve your dialogue scenes to make them faster and smoother is to take out those constant interruptions that don't really matter and don't add much and just let the characters talk so please stop ejaculating at me make sure it's clear but let the characters talk however as always doing this too much can lead to another problem talking heads which is where the reader has no idea what to visualize as characters are talking this is also one reason that people typically say that you shouldn't start your novel with a line of dialogue it's why it's really important to set the scene beforehand as pullman and larson do before a dialogue heavy scene especially establishing the things that characters will interact with later on as they talk creating a continuity to the physical space in the conversation and sprinkling in some action beats to physicalize what they're really saying that helps so you should be getting the impression that it's a balancing act all of this will just tighten up your dialogue it'll flow better and sound better and it's relatively easy to do now the hard part of dialogue is something else it's part three character voice and making characters sound different how do you get your characters to sound like different people well the answer is actually pretty simple one character uses sid and the other character uses ejaculate this was one problem that came up during my beta reading that all my characters sounded a little bit too similar or too much like me they didn't have distinct character voices writing advice around character voice talks a lot about how people say things word choice and syntax and accents but what really helped me was thinking about the role characters play in the dialogue scene and the focus of their dialogue have a listen to tyrion lannister here singer tyrion said turning to berlion when you make a ballads of this be certain you tell them how lady aaron denied the dwarf the right to a champion and sent him forth lame and bruised and hobbling to face her finest night you're asking a lame man to teach a how to dance tareen said however sincere the lesson the result is likely to be grotesque when talking about something tyrion lannister focuses on the cruelties of others and how humiliating something might be for someone how it affects the outcasts because he is familiar with cruelty and is an outcast of sorts he's got the same education vocabulary class syntax and accent as say tywin lannister but he has a totally different character voice because of that focus tywin lannister would have focused on the damage done to the lannister name if you want just a great example of this kind of character voice i recommend checking out torchwood it's an adult sci-fi show about a specialist group dealing with alien technology and their intense bisexuality and i was shocked with how well they did all of this kind of thing it's just a great show okay when i looked at my writing part of the reason my characters sounded similar was that they all approached discussions from kind of the same angle mirroring each other's points and concerns especially in scenes where they weren't in direct conflict when i made my characters approach the same discussion from different angles even just slightly by giving them a different aspect to focus on in line with their character their different character voices really came out the pessimist might focus on the dangers the overconfident character will gloss over their weaknesses and focus on their strengths so instead of thinking about a scene as my characters talk about this thing i divided up those concerns and points or invented new ones to give each character a different angle to approach the discussion from so they each bring something unique to the conversation sharpening those little differences between them it doesn't need to be confrontational and it can be really subtle but say giving each character a specific piece of information that only they would notice or a unique way of framing the thing that only they would see it as can be really effective let's look at an example from jeff vandermeer's annihilation after the characters find a strange alien writing on the wall i'm just using the dialogue here because the prose isn't that important biologist some sort of fungi the leaders here are made from fruiting bodies surveyor words made of fungi anthropologist there is no recorded human language that uses this method of writing is there any animal that communicates this way biologist no there is no animal that communicates this way surveyor are you joking this has to be a joke right biologist fruiting bodies forming words the biologist focuses on how strange the role of fruiting bodies is while the surveyor someone who isn't quite a believer that all of this weird stuff is happening focuses on how this might signal intense danger for them meanwhile the anthropologist a more solution focused character focuses on reasoning how this might have come to be contrasting with the biologists just simple curiosity the biologists now could have reasonably said it would have made perfect sense if they said it's some sort of fungi i can't think of any animal that writes like this it can't be a good sign can it but vandemir didn't do that he divided up these focuses amongst the characters with whatever fit them most giving them more distinct character voices by giving them each a role to play in the scene with a different way to frame what they're talking about i really like looking at focus because it imbues dialogue with that really important kind of character subtext our needs and wants our strengths and weaknesses way more than say word choice does which a lot of people focus on when creating character voice what we look at and focus on is a lot more indicative of our internal world and thus gives us a stronger character voice and this is all pretty closely connected to the role they play in dialogue think about the x-files skully is the skeptic about the aliens and all these weird happenings while mulder is the believer the conspiracy theorist the wild thinker the writers could have had mulder and skully both be skeptical or both be believers but their dialogue really comes alive because they play such distinct different roles in their scenes together the pessimist might focus on the dangers the characters are going to encounter the overconfident character will gloss over their weaknesses and focus on their strengths now at the same time don't let this get tropy where characters are forced to only have one attitude to things you know the big tough guy goes wanna smash and only thinks about brute force at every opportunity but having them take on broadly different roles will inform their focus and give them a different voice but what about all of the other stuff you know our class and sex and age and accent and education all of those things will impact our character voice the words and expressions we use our syntax how long we take to express things how forceful or restrained or poetic we are how much we listen or speak over others an upperclass person might always use their manners a child is more likely to get distracted as they speak house of leaves by marxia danielewski is a perfectly normal book with absolutely nothing disconcerting about it and it has great character writing on this level have a listen i'm possessed by an eerie pre-sentiment that all is not well was he you're leaving that seemed to offer up a discordant note the way you turned your back on your mother and not only looked back twice not that twice shouldn't have been more than enough after all once was too much for orpheus but your looking seemed to signal in my heart some message of mortal wrong this frat boy swaying back and forth before me like an idiot raises his axe even higher above his head his plan i see is not too complicated he intends to drive that heavy blade into my skull across the bridge of my nose cleave the roof of my mouth the core of my brain split apart the vertebrae in my neck and you just won't stop there either look at how much we know about these people just from how they talk the mother's word choice tells us she's educated possibly upper class likely a fair bit older she clearly overthinks as well the term mother rather than mom makes her seem overly composed maybe a little distant in the second though the language is kind of plain gritty and relatively simple he's a straightforward man smart but not too pretentious the term frat boy is also derogatory telling us he's probably a bit older but there is actually a more important element underneath all of this all the stuff we've been discussing and that is contrast between characters with house of leaves and annihilation and the point of focus it's the contrast between the characters that makes their character voices so distinct just as much as the language itself so here are five things to keep in mind when you want to contrast your characters number one speaking patterns in avatar the last airbender ang will often make call backs and comparisons to the past when reasoning things through soccer often falls into lecture mode where he will bring in details that slowly build up before he reveals a plan or an invention because he likes to show his reasoning before his solution toff however speaks in short sentences compared to katara she is very to the point very blunt whereas katara tiptoes a little bit more around how others are feeling 2. how they present information this will change from scene to scene because it's very tied to their emotions but keep in mind who could be speaking emotively versus sticking to the cold hard facts phrasing things as definites and certainties versus using a lot of maybes and mites and if it's okay rambling versus pointed language these will obviously create contrast between characters three word choice yep absolutely it does matter in the great gatsby gatsby is the only character to use the term old sport all to give the impression that he's aristocratic born to old money and an upper class background my girlfriend was telling me the other day that i use the words notorious and fundamentally all the time and that nobody else in her life does because you see fundamentally i'm a bit notorious for that it's probably because i like being academic i have a law degree and they like fancy words there but it does make me sound distinct doesn't it consider giving characters words or phrases that only they use every so often and it doesn't need to be extreme or it can be a bit gimmicky where they're using the same catchphrase every single line like a character from a video game to be honest gatsby's pretty close to that at times but lastly different metaphors and comparisons let's look at this line again from annihilation the surveyor spoke in this case i feel that we should rule out the tunnel as something invasive or threatening before we explore further it's like an enemy at our backs otherwise if we press forward the surveyor has a military background and approaches this discussion by framing it in these military terms the other characters are scientists and will often draw metaphors and comparisons that come from their discipline biology psychology or anthropology they all use technical language so in that way they're actually all quite similar but this contrast makes them distinct again five contrast how their dialogue looks on the page this is a really easy visual cue that just sits in the back of the reader's mind not just how they talk but who interrupts more who speaks for short periods versus long periods who has to have the last word in a conversation who dominates the conversation who takes a back seat now i wanna be clear you do not need to contrast in everything but contrasting a few of these things in dialogue scenes will really help sharpen those differences between them as people but again but here is the trippy thing part four it is okay if characters sound the same sometimes i have read way too many examples where characters are just a caricature of contrast especially where accents get involved hello there mcdougall would you like to go to cafe get coffee ah no laddie i have to go down to the pub well they're clearly different characters the whole advice you should be able to remove dialogue tags and still tell who is speaking is only uh sometimes helpful yes you want them to sound different and sometimes that will be the case but a lot of what we say can be said by a lot of people and that's okay that's why i prefer to look at focus in dialogue because people can sound similar and use similar words but it's still clearly one character or another the golden rule is really this not every piece of dialogue needs to sound like it could have only come from one character but every character needs some dialogue that only sounds like them part five realistic dialogue this is a rabbit hole to go down but here we go you've probably heard listen to real people talk but what does that even mean everyone talks differently especially fictional people i ejaculate in protest dialogue in real life is full of pointless tangents and comparisons and dead ends but fictional dialogue always has a point so instead you are creating the illusion of realism a neat way to help with this is to let the dialogue be a little bit out of order let me explain when we're talking we don't perfectly follow on from what others are saying a lot of the time because we focus on different things we don't respond directly and we rephrase the conversation in our turns we introduce other concerns and that makes the conversation just a little bit out of step we'll often go and then address whatever they said before but sometimes it'll be a bit round about getting there let's have a look at that bit from annihilation again biologist some sort of fungi the letters here are made from fruiting bodies survey words made of fungi anthropologist there is no recorded human language that uses this method of writing is there any animal that communicates this way biologist no there is no animal that communicates this way surveyor are you joking this has to be a joke right biologist fruiting bodies forming words they're all talking about the fungus writing but on three slightly different conversational threats the biologist frames it as a weird natural phenomena while the anthropologist frames it as outside of human civilization meanwhile the surveyor is focused on how disconcerting or even dangerous this is the biologist does directly respond to the anthropologist but not the surveyor whose thread goes unanswered until later and none of them respond to the biologist thread until a little bit later as well these conversational threads are developing but a little out of order a little out of sync now imagine if it were written like this anthropologist it's some sort of fungi biologist yes the letters are made from fruiting bodies following words anthropologist is there any animal that communicates this way biologist no there is no animal that communicates this way anthropologist there is no recorded human language that uses this method of writing either biologist then who wrote this survey are you joking this is a joke right biologist i don't think so anthropologist not after everything we've seen here a thread is introduced it's addressed and then a new thread is introduced it's not terrible but it feels a little more stilted because everything is perfectly in order it all sounds a little mechanical so maybe jumble up your dialogue threads a bit people reacting to some but not others making assertions of their own before responding to what was said before remarking something to themselves in their own world it helps it feel realistically a little out of step as the conversation progresses another thing is that people don't really talk in grammatically correct ways half sentences run-on sentences often cutting off the beginning or end just saying the core bit the biologist says fruiting bodies forming words and that's because that's how her thought process sounds just these fragments especially in more casual settings we tend to speak in full sentences when we want to be understood or heard when we want to take control of a situation when we want to be more professional but that flexibility with our syntax and grammar is very human in dialogue part six dialogue versus summarizing you do not need to write out every single exchange that a character has in your book in the same way that you don't need to write out every single move that your character makes luckily novels can do something that plays and films cannot do nearly as easily we can summarize a call from my mom a few weeks later reminded me just how far from home i was she talked about her blooming chrysanthemums that she had learned to play debussy's cleared a loon on the piano and the dany was following in my footsteps and excelling in math and physics the weather had been hot the days long and the flowers leaves and trees had all come out in company william was out of the picture but she was brighter with every note yet as i listened to mum telling me about all the things that had changed it was apparent how much it remained the same too she was a better person than me hey mum i said as she went to end the call yes i love you a fleeting paw is tagged the end of the sentence i love you too james i realized she had been waiting for her but silence is the sound of something said far too rarely and i actually wrote that passage i've been trying to force myself to share more of my writing with you but that is from my fiction book which i've been taking to agents and i'm stoked to that because i've sent it off to about 10 so far and it's been a major goal of mine this year anyways so here are three things that you might summarize one my character here is telling his mom that he loves her it's an important story beat for him but i didn't want the mum to feature personally in the story too much and i didn't want to spend too much time basically writing out small talk which is kind of boring to read so instead i summarized the feeling and flow of the conversation to give the reader a sense of what it was like and i only use dialogue to lay out this really important moment at the end it doesn't feel out of place but secondly you might also summarize filler dialogue sometimes authors will need to have a few different conversations in a particular scene and then we'll try to awkwardly segue between them with some boring small talk or banter between the characters and it is super noticeable but what if instead you broke up those conversations by summarizing the flow and feel of the conversation for a bit and then cut back in with the interesting dialogue that we actually care about three interlate leave early basically what this means is leave out all the boring stuff at the start and end of a dialogue scene ever wondered why nobody says hello and just hangs up the phone without saying goodbye in films this is why the sky was lighter already there was a faint fresh stirrer in the air what's that you've got said mrs lonsdale closing the battered little suitcase with the snap the master gave it to me can't go in the suitcase too late i'm not opening up now it'll have to go in your code pocket whatever it is hurry on down to the battery don't keep them waiting it was only after she said goodbye to the few servants who were up and to mrs lonsdale that she remembered roger and she felt guilty for not having thought of him once since meeting mrs colter here pullman cuts into the conversation with mrs lonsdale without any pleasantries and leaves it just summarizing the goodbyes i've also linked a rule around the car's novella submergence down below which you can read for free because she strikes this balance fantastically every single line is super important and she knows when to summarize when to enter and when to leave in books people kind of assume that characters say hello and goodbye and do the small talk an easy way to tidy up your dialogue then is to get rid of these pleasantries and summarize outside of the core point of the dialogue scene it also allows you to keep up the pace and focus on the point of the conversation the drama that we're interested in like the early theometer that lyra has just been given but sometimes you want to do small talk i have a scene in my book where two characters are refusing to talk about a serious issue they have with each other then they bump into each other i laid out all of the small talk because i wanted the reader to feel that awkward space where the characters aren't really saying anything because they're avoiding talking about the things that really matter now if you found this video helpful or my work more broadly helpful then i really recommend picking up on writing world building volume 2. it is written for you and you can get volume one super cheap right now if you want as well and once you've got a copy write a review on amazon i cannot understate how important reviews are once this got a bunch of them it kicked it into another gear and is now selling all on its own really thank you links down below or just chuck them on your christmas list but really thank you because these were only made possible with you and they're for you oh you're just the most beautiful sexy book in the world he ejaculated it's purely professional but let me just bring this all together and i promise to speak calmly i will not ejaculate summary action tanks can replace dialog tags add more variety indicate cadence or which lines are important and allow you to control the pacing of a scene but too many of them can be really clunky said encompasses a lot of different ways of saying things which is why using other words too much can sound melodramatic look to replace placeholder dialogue tags like replied and those that indicate a line is more intense than you truly want it to be sometimes action tags better accomplish the same thing 3. however other texts can still be a great shorthand way of indicating intensity cadence or emotion when you don't want to spend too many words they can mark when the scene changes gear and tension or emotion or they can give information that's just not immediately apparent in the dialogue four let characters talk for god's sake but don't let them become talking heads five allowing each character to approach the same topic from a different angle with a different aspect to focus on helps develop their character voice it also infuses their dialogue with more character subtext 6. contrast is just as important not in every way but in some speaking patterns how they present information word choice expressions the comparisons and metaphors they use and how their dialogue looks on the page seven not every piece of dialogue needs to sound like it could only come from one character but every character needs some dialogue that only sounds like them and eight realistic dialogue is flexible in its syntax and grammar especially in casual settings and often has conversation threads moving a little bit out of step i guess that's it i hope you guys like this video stay nerdy and i'll see you in the future get the book blah blah blah blah get the book get it all go buy the book do it you know you want it put on your christmas list get it this book is a cod so all so all brin so all brand new stuff all brand new stuff all brand new stuff all brand new stuff how am i spending half an hour doing this this is a whole rabbit this is a whole this is a rabbit this is a whole this is a whole rabbit this is a whole rabbit hold down but here we go\n",

      "can you imagine what it must have been like to live in the centuries following the fall of the roman empire the greatest power the world had ever seen gone ancient historians describe god paying out the wages of sin and strife and war and disease the land itself dying away the average peasant in the middle ages must have wandered around these ruins old walls to keep out forgotten foes wondering what these magnificent structures were for monuments to a lost past it's that feeling you got when you first encountered the halo ring or entered a cauldron in horizon zero dawn or explored a dwemer ruin for the first time as a kid i was told that rome fell when the goths invaded and sacked the city one dark night and the empire was snuffed out of course in reality rome's fall was neither quick nor simple but it makes for a good story doesn't it that's why we keep coming back to these ancient civilizations their stories of how they rose so high like icarus and a little too close to the sun before of course they too inevitably fall [Music] [Music] and thank you so much to world anvil for sponsoring this video part one mythology humanity brought themselves to an apocalyptic end with the remnants of civilization not truly understanding what happened maybe it was a manufactured virus or a super superweapon gone wrong throw in a dash of genius and a smattering of hubris and you've almost definitely got some sort of apocalyptic end with the remnants of civilization not truly understanding what happened before either way the world is now divided into tribes or clans or new nations even with each group developing a different relationship with these ancestors of sorts who built the world that they now live in the ruins of sounds like horizon zero dawn right but actually i was describing transsour book by gary paulsen that i read when i was 12. horizon is just the latest most beautiful example in part this world building resonates because so much of culture and personal identity is our collective relationship with the past the historic moments that we believe define our way of life our greats and our terribles and fallen civilizations fit into that like a perfect glove different groups in these worlds are going to have different cultural relationships with this ancient bygone hubris filled civilization shaped by the role their remnants play in modern life and horizon does this brilliantly the nora tribe dares not use the artifacts of the old ones seeing them as sacred or cursed they see this fallen civilization as something to be learned from yeah revered as wise and all-knowing largely because they attribute their safety in the mountains to the all-mother who is actually an artificial intelligence in contrast the eclipse revere the old ones for their raw destructive power the weapons they created and they see themselves as their true descendants in a sense having mastered the same weapons and the irony of these stories is that they're often cyclical they explore how people or humanity make the same mistakes over and over again regardless of how advanced they are in the sense that these aren't just interpretations of the past of fallen civilizations are they they're narratives that fit into the modern biases and goals and philosophies of the people at hand the nora are an isolationist holier than thou people and they use their connection to the old ones to justify why they stay apart from the world while the eclipse are an expansionist aggressive militaristic faction admiring the old ones for doing the exact same thing that they are doing we like to think of history as a concrete list of people and facts and places and dates and events but it's much closer to a story we tell ourselves a wibbly wobbly ball of feelings our understanding of the past affects our view of the present and our view of the present affects our understanding of the past and this isn't inherently a terrible thing it's just part of consciousness we can barely make sense of ourselves let alone all of existence but it can be good or bad you know when the nazis rose to power herman worth believed and i kid you not that atlantis you know the greek technological superpower was originally inhabited by germanic people because are you ever suggesting that other races could do such a thing as this hitler had this kind of obsession with rome and ancient greece and was trying to create and force this lineage between them and nazi germany in the 1930s and 40s as a way of kind of justifying that they're the natural leaders of europe that is funny because it's dumb but because of this it's easy to see how our understanding of the past will change as we learn but also as political and cultural movements rise and fall over time and this is especially tempting to do when we know so little about these past civilizations which is especially common in these types of stories so when we're building this you've got to look for those gaps that people are going to exploit to interpret in their own way to make them say whatever they wanted to say condemning a particular way of living because it caused the fall of civilization before or defining what it means to be a citizen or justifying a modern genocide in shards of earth by adrian tchaikovsky the originators leave behind these ruins which somehow repel these ancient eldritch planet-consuming beings and there's this faction who believe that humanity are the true descendants of the originators the only rightful heirs and that justify seizing anything they built but really it's more to do with their hatred for other aliens after losing planet earth itself the world of horizon is made all the more immersive by how it interrogates these ideas we feel connected to the distant past because it lets us believe our way of life came from somewhere it makes us feel a little less like we're making it up as we go along when if we think about it too long that's exactly what we're doing okay and it's especially easy to look at this ancient fallen technologically advanced civilization and think they must have known better right or it's nice to have hope that a people could get that far so long as they just don't head in that same destructive direction we mythologize the past all the time we romanticize and villainize it especially those parts of history that we feel a connection to or that challenge the way we view ourselves in halo the covenant wants to see itself as carrying the mantle of those that created the halo rings giving rise to all sorts of myths and legends and misinformed beliefs and all because they saw that the forerunners did these incredible things they built these amazing structures and they want to see themselves in them they want to see themselves as like them just as great just as holy in shards of earth by adrian tchaikovsky people want to view the originators who left behind these huge ruins as benevolent gods all because they are equally terrified of these other ancient creatures that seem to be out there and after them they want to feel a little safer and to be clear even when we do know a lot about these ancient civilizations that still doesn't stop us making it up okay we know a crapton about the fall of the roman empire and ancient china and you're still gonna hear people saying rome fell because people got fat and lazy and that's why we need conscription today when it's so much more complicated than that i don't know if you've heard the line hard times make strong men strong men make good times good times make weak men and weak men make hard times it's absolutely nonsense it's a historical makes absolutely no sense but doesn't stop people saying it and applying it to history and going hey look this is just like now but it's a narrative that people like to map onto civilizational collapse in the past so that they can map it onto the present i mean what's a truly awful time or place in history that people idolize today for political reasons go on i know something came to mind tell me down below and why so let's imagine graham the residualized cancer is exploring this world where an ancient civilization created multiple space stations overhead so large that they became a series of moons others see them as bad omens causing eclipses but his culture reveres them as guardians of the land but when harsh weather forces his people to migrate the orbit of these space stations becomes a guide for where graham should migrate to so imagine an example horizon zero dawn and halo tell a surprisingly similar story but there's a reason that horizon does it better despite sharing the same question who built this world and what happened to them the revelation about what the halo is and what happened to the forerunners doesn't really matter to master chief does it in contrast ailoy is born into a culture of admiration for the old ones and she has a deep connection with them personally because she was born from one of their facilities and doesn't know why learning about how the old ones fell isn't just a fascinating layered mystery but a journey that answers personal questions and challenges her understanding of herself and the world it's a brilliant example of connecting this kind of worldbuilding to story one of the hallmarks of the planet of hats trope is that every person in a civilization feels the same way about something you know they're all thieves or they're all samurais but horizon gives us so many different cultural and personal understandings of the old ones that you can't help but buy into it it makes it feel so much more immersive because our world is shaped by the past even more so if we feel that we live part two in the ruins of greatness now your precursors may have left no mark on the world whatsoever but personally in my opinion any great fallen civilization worth their fallenness or their greatness leaves behind a good number of relics and ruins and remnants for people to find on their travels sunken beneath the sea or buried underground or scattered across the land i mean lovecraft and asimov stories are just littered with precursor civilizations i love reading passages like this they had built the concrete pillars that pierced the sky painted every picture on those huge canvases and marked every street corner with mysterious red and yellow signs and they had done it with hands far nimbler than toaster's own which were just two forks better at stacking boxes than bricklaying and art creatures of iron squatted in the wreckage of bridges and town halls watching toaster and motherboard as they trekked by constellations of concrete and steel latched onto the morning light to make themselves more beautiful to remind themselves of what they had once looked like and that wasn't actually lovecraft or asimov that was me it's from my short story two robots at the end of the world which is being published this april in utopia science fiction magazine i'm a published fiction of the guys i've read little parts of it before and you'll finally have the full story but you don't have to wait i would love you not to wait because you can read another one of my short stories right now panstella it was just published in macro microcosm magazine and it follows a girl who discovers as a child that the stars are going out looking at how civilization and we should face death and the inevitable end i guess and it's not because i'm going to be getting money from this i'm i'm not i just really want to share my work with you and there are links down the description to go check those out if you'd like to support me just on a one-off occasion this is the way to do it there's a link down below i just want to share my work with you either way unless your new world has reached the same level of technology or superseded the old world you're gonna find something like two worlds laid over one another and even then they would have developed differently let me explain what that means one way to look at it is like two maps over the same land there's this one for the ancient civilization with all of that power and technology and might it must have worked differently to the modern one where could they have built cities that are no longer possible where were its important trade routes no longer viable what marks them or it's old borders that are no longer defended and then there's the new world and it works differently nk jemisin's the fifth season is a fantasy book based in a world that is periodically ravaged by geologically apocalyptic events that topple civilization on a semi-regular basis as a result the world is littered with ancient ruins and artifacts and remnants that shape the story world there are marks of cities too far from arable land now built along dangerous trading routes or dependent on high investment resources like deep mines that no longer have the workforce or market to make it even worth harvesting you require more vesping gas oh god damn it instead the world has retracted to the safest places it can be away from fault lines cities require a large stable economy to sustain them and so in the wake of civilizational collapse people tend to disperse into the countryside into smaller communities and you can reflect that in your world relying on more easily accessible resources and trade routes meaning that these ancient cities were set up in places that didn't really work anymore especially if those regions themselves became especially volatile and unstable politically and economically and so the bigger the sociological and technological difference between your new world and your old one the bigger the difference in their layout might be with different priorities and different capacities even if some people do inhabit those ancient places you're gonna see those reflected and how the kingdoms and new ways of the world are laid out or maybe there aren't marks all over the world for whatever reason but their remains will continue to be coveted you know sites of political capital of tourism of financial interest are alien relics left behind might get sold on the black market or they might be studied like the know my ruins in outer wilds especially if there's inconveniently deadly technology just lying around rather neglectful god like alien beings in that case i always found it weird that the stargates were so often just left abandoned by the wraith and gold who both knew how to use them these are intergalactic portals that give you immense power you would build fortresses around them okay i mean at least in halo the covenant tries to control the ring the moment they find it and in horizon the moment they find workable old one technology they build a freaking industry around it again in shards of earth originated technology becomes infinitely economically valuable because it is the only thing that can ward off these terrifying eldritch beings from another dimension and one faction uses that to take over human planets join us or we're gonna let you die it's not a special relationship just an application of originated technology to the modern practical political realities either way you've got to ask what role the marks they left behind will play economically socially religiously politically and militarily all of which will change again with those cultural and personal relationships that people in your world develop with the civilization because us humans at least love fitting these sorts of things into our narratives and legends and family legacies see in the world of grand wizard likes cats sometimes these ancient artifacts fall to earth and people build new homes around them they harvest these ancient strong metals and they're also these roads that were built up to mountain peaks that are no longer used because they can't survive up in there anymore but back in the old days they lived up there they have the technology too that art has long since been lost though see at the heart of a lot of these stories is that old axiom we all know those who do not learn from history are part three doomed to repeat how did they fall we talk a lot about the lessons of history whatever the hell they are right but what is a greater lesson than the fall of a great civilization with a natural disaster a war a super weapon gone wrong hubris their fall often acts as a warning thematically especially if there's some parallel with the plot in the story or the character's actions or commentary on our world as it stands today not taking care of the environment or the environment tuning against us is increasingly common these days and it's not hard to tell why in doctor who the time lords were wiped out in a huge war against the daleks which the story makes clear is the worst war that has ever existed and could ever exist anywhere anytime ever a warning against the self-destructive nature of violence though it underpins the thematic crux of the series of empathy over violence which is often echoed in the doctor's actions himself having come from war and grown out of it i never would have you got that i never would make the foundation of this society a man who never would in the same way that a story isn't just the characters and events of the plot world building isn't just the places and history of your world it's thematic and i don't mean that in the sense that you've got to have a moral to your world but that in how you create this world you can discuss interesting ideas and that's cool like middle-earth world building discusses a lot of humanity's relationship with the soul and god so you've got to think about what messages you might be embedding in your world and how that interacts with your story and it doesn't just have to be from how the civilization fell but it can be from the world they left behind i don't think i've quite experienced the world as vivid as susanna clark's piranesi in a long while gigantic halls filled with statues some as small as a human and others as large as giants and all the while the oceans tides are washing through these corridors and halls and it's bizarre and weird and i love it we don't know who built this place or what happened to them and the story never seeks to answer it but the world in paranesse speaks to isolation and memory and identity and what makes us us about how we compartmentalize our lives and our relationships with the past and other people and our small place in the world i guess it's all embedded in the world building itself as much as it is in the story i think halo has a lot to say about say parenthood through the lens of this forerunner civilization and the mantle uh coming before humanity and the precursors again before then there's this generational feel to it in the case of grain the wazoo likes cats let's imagine that the civilization wiped themselves out having fused with technology many became so detached from the real world that they found no point in existing and subsequently deleting themselves maybe graham's arc and his story is one of finding meaning and fighting suicidal thoughts and naturally we can connect this world building to that story these worlds in many ways cause us to reflect on the future as much as the past that we have built over the remnants of the past and one day maybe we will be the ruins that people find when they come to earth and we're long gone and they wonder what happened here we feel safe in our ivory towers right now with all the knowledge and technology and beauty and power that we have amassed beautiful and shining but ivory is fragile and everything cracks under the weight of time because everything has its time and everything dies part four collapse is complicated it's a lot easier to say room fell in 14 when the goth sacked roman alaric crowned himself emperor it's a lot more fun even isn't it gives us a villain and a shakespearean tragedy of sorts and it doesn't ask us to consider our own society because you know the visigoths aren't on our doorstep it's a lot easier than thinking about deflation and population collapse and disease management and the increasing elite mismanagement of the economy huh but okay fair i know why you're here what if you want them to collapse realistically i read joseph tainter's the collapse of complex societies to get a better understanding and the simple answer is not simple you could say societal collapse is complicated i have brought peace freedom justice and security to my new empire i love democracy there was a lot of complicated information but i'm going to boil it down to what i think tanta recognized as six major factors in societal collapse and he had a whole pet theory of his own but he at least recognized that these played important roles in some way one depletion or loss of a vital resource like water gold coal oil or some other fictional resource that your civilization may have depended on you must construct additional pylons pylons us humans were wiped out in horizon zero dawn when we ran out of well any living thing two insurmountable catastrophe like extreme weather volcanic eruptions earthquakes or disease that the state cannot simply manage and just fractures the nomi in outer wilds were wiped out by ghost matter a deadly interstellar disease and they were too slow to manage it three insufficient responses to circumstances the argument here is that complicated societies are often slow and bureaucratic they're mired in factional disputes that prevent them from mustering the response to a crisis that it needs like say the environment was getting destroyed not that we have any experience with that four invasions from the outside say destroying infrastructure killing people like in halo with the forerunners five class conflict causing disruptions in production politics trade and security a divide between economic groups and society that eventually divides the state itself or at least causes revolution this was notably one of the more universal ones and six economic factors like deflation debt trade route destruction overtaxation they're all pretty tied to class conflict as well aren't they most of these played some kind of role in the fall of the mayans the old egyptian kingdom the romans the han dynasty old babylon sargon of akkad the bronze age collapse but tainter does argue that these are insufficient by themselves like for example it doesn't make sense to say that complex societies are more vulnerable to huge natural disasters or insufficiently responding so much because large more centralized societies are actually the most equipped to deal with them and we do deal with them all the time they've got more resources more manpower so instead he argues this is the central problem diminishing returns to complexity carried far enough it brings on economic stagnation and ineffective problem solving in its most severe form it has made societies vulnerable to collapse because severing their ties to the regional entity might yield highly increased marginal productivity i know it's complicated but basically we invest more money and time and more of our freedom in creating more complex state entities to solve bigger more complex problems but eventually these problems keep getting bigger and people start to realize that they're not getting as much out of becoming more complex investing more in that state body so instead of trying to solve the problem by investing more in that centralized power it becomes more attractive to split off to break away to try and solve it in a new way this taken to a deeper extreme causes the state to collapse or it might at least weaken it greatly until eventually it fractures entirely now tainter does insist that elite mismanagement is only one factor but i will note that reading it it keeps on coming up it keeps on coming up over and over again about how much the elite screw things over in these societies elites letting society become too dependent on one resource you require more vesping gas because they'll be fine if it collapses and it's better financially than it is to pivot elites being the ones to insufficiently respond because they don't face the consequences of the catastrophe as badly elite being the exploitative end of the class conflict elites dividing themselves into factions that make it hard to get anything done and elites being the ones making decisions like over-taxing and deflating currency and building an economy on top of subprime mortgages which will inevitably fail in the 2008 financial crisis make of that what you will half of my lights just ran out of batteries so we're running on this and daylight if you want your collapse to be more realistic then consider using some of these in the run-up you know even if it does have a dramatic end consider whether these things might facilitate it might make it more in-depth i've been reading ian banks's accession recently about this apex galactic level civilization called the culture coming up against maybe the first real problem that they have ever encountered something they don't actually understand what they call the outside context problem an outside context problem was the sort of thing most civilizations encountered just once imagine you were a tribe on a large-ish fertile island you tamed the land invented the wheel or writing or whatever you were in a position of near absolute power and control when suddenly this bristling lump of iron appears in the bay and these guys carrying long funny looking sticks come ashore and announce you've just been discovered you're all subjects of the emperor now he's keen on prisons called tax and these bright-eyed holy men would like a word with your priests now i know that the culture won't fall in this book but it is a fascinating story about how elite mismanagement and cultural divides can cause instability and threaten a society even one as powerful and advanced as this with collapse these worlds are mysterious and provocative and intoxicating alien makes us feel small and weak on the galactic scale horizon zero dawn is somber but familiar it captures that longing for the past halo fills us with awe of a universe so much bigger than us outer wild speaks to how everything has its time and everything dies but sometimes new life will be borne afterwards neon evangelion reminds us that no matter how great or powerful or advanced we become people are still the same they keep making the same mistakes over time again and again still just as selfish still just as flawed and just as good too in all cases though these stories echo deeply held desires to be connected to be more to have hope and maybe your story might have some answers i used wild anvil throughout this video to help show the incredible world building you can do with it you know timelines and maps and pages for your ancient settlements and technologies and myths and legends that relationship and mythologization we talked about countries and organizations that make up your fallen civilization perhaps or whatever else you want it to be i try to only take sponsors that i feel are going to be genuinely helpful and useful to you and world anvil has been leading the way with making world building fun and easy and accessible for the longest time they deserve the place they've got and by the way they didn't pay me to say that that's me saying that okay i could work with a lot of bigger companies but i choose to work with them so no more complaining about how hard it is to keep track of your world building because world anvil does it for you and you get to make it all pretty you get to make a wiki which is exactly what you want so checking out world anvil by clicking my link down below helps me keep doing this kind of work because yeah it takes a lot of research okay and it would also help you build your world which is the really important bit including if you want to expand into dnd games with stats and there's also a manuscript editor now which i think is fantastic it lets you link things from your stories to pages that you have created which personally i think is a fantastic evolution on the ebook format and it needs to be used more but what really makes wardanville is that it encourages you to think more deeply about your world and asks the right questions so let me make you an offer you can't refuse i receive good sponsor you receive good world building click the link and of course what would it be without a summary one deepen your world building by having different groups develop different cultural relationships with that fallen civilization admiration revulsion affinity two we mythologize the past all the time especially when we don't know what happened the fallen civilization will naturally fit into and foster biases and narratives legends and myths three if your story focuses on understanding quote how it happened consider how the revelation can emotionally impact your characters connecting the world building to story 4. the ancient civilization would have been built and developed in different places and ways to the world that came after especially if it's less advanced think about how that level of tech power and coordination would change where and how they developed the land 5. figure out how the ruins remnants and relics of ancient technology and life will be used politically socially economically and religiously especially in the case of weapons okay six word building is thematic in the same way stories are what do you want this fallen civilization to say how can it build into the narratives and themes of the story seven societal collapse is complicated it often involves depletion or loss of a vital resource insurmountable catastrophe insufficient responses to circumstances invasions class comfort economic crisis and elite mismanagement eight societies become more centralized and complex to solve more complex problems but eventually there are diminishing marginal returns at which point it becomes more attractive to split off from the state causing collapse of that complexity there we have it guys so word anvil but also go read panstella that would mean a hell of a lot to me stay nerdy stay reading and i will see you in the future you\n",

      "stories are a way for us to escape to cast ourselves off to Fantastical places imaginary worlds we can immerse ourselves in but how do you do that what makes these places so vivid and magical and how do you capture it is with detail creativity and metaphors or something more that's why I've been studying 31 books from amazing authors across a ton of genres even different languages why their descriptions work and what we can learn come explore with me let's go foreign [Music] video discussing more about description as episode 4 of my ongoing Beyond writing series which you can get access to with the Curiosity stream nebula bundle linked below as they've kindly sponsored this video it's really great to be able to sponsor videos with my own content use my link down in the description part one the first mistake writers make one of the easiest traps that people fall into is thinking good description is about trying to find the prettiest words to replicate what you have in your mind in the mind of the reader the Trap being that that's a lie funded by big description no the Trap being that it is partly that but not only that one trying to perfectly replicate what you have in your mind is never going to work even if they're close and that's part of the beauty of writing right but hurling a list of nouns and adjectives at the reader doesn't necessarily help us immerse ourselves in the setting or remember it and that's because I found that the best descriptions focus on experience over details we slept in what had once been a gymnasium the floor was a varnished wood with stripes and circles painted on it for the games that were formerly played there the Hoops for the basketball nets were still in place though the Nets were gone a balcony ran around the room for the spectators and I thought I could smell faintly like an after image the pungent scent of sweat shot through with a sweet taint of chewing gum and perfume from the watching girls dances would have been held there the music lingered a palimpsest of unheard sound there was old sex in the room and loneliness and expectation of something without a shape or name Atwood could if he had just listed the vanished wood stripes and hoops and balcony in a string of nouns and adjectives and it would have been accurate but the words and framing like had once been formally an afterimage and lingering focus on how this setting feels lifeless isolating and empty compared to what it once was in other words the experience the reality is that we don't seem to remember that many details about a place we do however remember the general Impressions and feelings we associate with a place so I'm curious for your thoughts What fictional Place feels most Vivid and real to you let me know down below one really common piece of writing advice that rises out of this is to use the five senses and it is true in part that we often rely too much on site part of the reason Edward's description here is so vivid is that it brings in elements of sound and smell but I actually think that the more important element here is that it would very deliberately includes details of sight smell and sound that all feed into creating this isolating lifeless world because that is the feeling we remember it's a kind of subtext that a lot of people Miss in reality now sometimes this can be the experience of a specific character especially in third limited or first person like Edward has here we see how offred longs for a time in the past but it's just as often the experience of the place more generally I'm just imagining someone describing everything by taste now they walk into a city and they just um the walls tastes like good old Egyptian Alabaster Bear Town isn't close to anything even on a map the place looks unnatural as if nature and man were fighting a tug of war for space and the town is losing it has been a very long time since it won at anything more jobs disappear each year and with them the people and the forest if ours one or two more abandoned houses each season sometimes the entire Community feels like a philosophical experiment if a town falls in the forest but no one hears it doesn't matter at all beer town is written in third person omniscient and this isn't channeling any specific character most of this language is quite evocative you know a tug of war with nature and the town is losing I just love that bit of just description Bachmann could have detailed any number of things which are factually in the town but he focuses on the experience of this place and the specific details he does include here build into that feeling rather than just being a list of things that are there but you know like when I talk about experience here it can be something really really simple you know like a Road Feeling busy a castle feeling empty a house feeling old it doesn't need to be deep or profound like these two so one if you're writing in first person or third limited then which details would your main character notice emphasize or minimize more than others would like offer it in the handmaid's tale notices the details of times past two what details or feelings does the place invoke and three do the details you mention feed into that impression not everything needs to but whatever you include keep in mind that so much of amazing description comes from part two specificity the ninth vestibule is remarkable for the three great staircases it contains its walls are lined with marble statues hundreds upon hundreds of them tear upon tear Rising into the distant Heights I climbed the Western Wall until I reached the statue of a woman carrying a beehive 15 meters above the pavement the woman is two or three times my own height and the Beehive is covered with marble B is the size of my thumb 1B this always gives me a slight sensation of queasiness crawls over her left eye specificity works on two levels one narrow in on details clunkier gives some general descriptions of the walls and staircases but she Narrows in on a particularly memorable image a woman carrying a beehive with a bee crawling over her eye it's visceral and memorable because it Sparks a sense of queasiness in us as well nobody wants a bug on their eye even a cute little bumblebee it's an experience through detail not General statements specificity can also be used to subtextually indicate which features of a location are more important without saying hey you've got to remember this you know it's gonna come back later so like if gray and The Wizard who likes cats comes across a creepy house you might narrow in on her a painting of a dead Dutch woman seems to watch you not only because it's creepy but because you know maybe it opens up to a secret passageway later I don't know details tend to be more memorable even if it's as simple as a wonky Table leg so oh my good friends my old Champs my illustrious lovers my mini-armed uh Companions compatriots of the modern day do you have a favorite specific detail that you've read or written that has really stuck with you I would love you to share it down below secondly word choice a purple flowering Vine had colonized the lighthouse wall and curled itself around the remains of the door on its left side the vine here hasn't just attached itself to the door but colonized it which has so many more connotations of it being possessive invasive personal especially in this book Annihilation if you've read it it's about the blurred line between you and your environment so you can use description to capture and reflect your themes as well also unfortunately someone seems to have stolen my copy of annihilation which is one of my favorite books um either so you're stuck with Jeff vandermeer's dead astronauts which is one of the weirdest books I have ever read and I've read House of leaves but look for whether you can use more specific nouns verbs and adjectives that add more connotations and subtexts to what you're describing but do be wary of exaggerating or dramatizing your descriptions we've all read those pieces with someone just refuses to use the terms you know red and blue and instead insist on Cerulean and Vermillion I mean what do those add really look at piranesi it's a visually stunning image but to be honest none of the verbs or nouns are especially that unique you know saying the Beehive was unwrapped in Marble doesn't really add depth or meaning over covered here whereas colonized very much does compared to attached and yeah sometimes it's okay to just list off a quick few details to ground someone in the scene not every place is going to have an experience you need to really think about I'm not saying you shouldn't do that but that this is something you should keep in mind for description more broadly you're laying out the mental landscape as much as the physical where someone needs to keep their attention what they need to remember what's meaningful okay so you know to talk about the experience you know to use specificity but in the first place you kind of got to know part three what to describe there are typically four things that really matter one set up and pay off establishing things in your setting that are gonna come back in the narrative later on especially if the tension is reliant on knowledge of those things otherwise it can kind of feel like this doesn't need to be super specific in A Song of Ice and Fire we're told that King's Landing has a ton of secret passageways but not where they are and it's still fine when they're used to help Tyrion escape prison because you know we have enough knowledge that it pays off sometimes features are also implicit in the setting like nobody is is going to question tables being in a great hall when they turn up in a fight scene even if you didn't mention them explicitly before but the more coincidental that a feature might appear the more you need to set that up in your description you know don't say oh they were in the library reading books when they get attacked and he grabs the Cthulhu statue smashes his opponent over the head and summons the Eldritch Gods when you never established the Cthulhu statue before two interesting features especially those that contradict the reader's expectations of what a setting is gonna be like now just because we find certain elements of our world or setting really interesting does not mean that the reader will but think about you know the bee crawling over that woman's eye that's an interesting image regardless three whatever gives a sense of place when describing King's Landing Martin highlights the great sift of baylord the Dragon pit the port and spends a lot of words on the red keep now none of these are particularly unique or important to our perspective character or very experiential to be perfectly honest but they're important to understand the layout of the city where a lot of this story is going to take place but sometimes again people will just end up with a parade of random details a string of nouns and adjectives that most people are gonna forget this is actually something that I think Tolkien is rightly criticized for bring me his head yes I know criticizing Tolkien I think I just angered the gods I await whatever curse you lay down upon me in the comments no but really he has beautiful poetic prose but also a tendency to describe his places with a laundry list of details that most people end up skipping over or tend to forget let's look at how he describes minus tirith he gives a good description at the start of how the gates and layered walls are laid out which is important for our sense of space especially in The Siege to come but then there's a lot of details like exact measurements and whether things face North or east or west and these odd details about the walls I think though this line at the end actually captures minus tirith better as a setting as a location more than any of the stuff before it does yet it was in truth falling year by year into Decay and already it lacked half the men that could have dwelt at ease there in every street they passed some great house or Court over whose doors and arched Gates were carved many Fair letters of strange and ancient shapes names Pippin guests of Great Men and kindreds that had once dwelt there and yet now they were silent and no footsteps rang on their wide Pavements nor Voice Was Heard in their Halls nor any face looked out from door or empty window not only are these great specific details but it gives us an experience of ministeris that we will remember a place falling into Decay is this my hottest take feel like saying Tolkien describes too much shouldn't be controversial and you know what the day may come when my courage fails and I forsake all bonds I have with this hot take but it is not this day this day I await the comments now I know I've spent a lot of this video railing against long lists of details because there are memorable uninteresting and they often kill the pacing all of that is true but that doesn't mean that a list of details can't be useful look at that description we had before in the handmaid's tale or beer town both have a string of details but again they fit into that overall experience or inform the sense of space really well a list of details can also be their own kind of specificity you know rather than picking a specific single detail to highlight the handmaid's tale is kind of that you know they have a series of really tactile physical sensory details attached to specific smells and sounds even if no specific detail stands out that much it's still very specific what you don't want is just a list of details that don't mean much and I hope I've kind of given you an idea of what does mean a lot but there is one last reason you might describe something you want to it's your story maybe you put a lot of effort into the architecture of your world and you just want to talk about it for a while I say go ahead no story is gonna work for everyone and trying to cater our book to be perfectly accessible to every person who might read it is just gonna stunt your own style a lot of the time these were the things that came to mind for me but what else do you feel you might want to describe but the funniest thing I learned when researching for this video is that really most writers don't need to learn how to better describe and you might be one of them what they actually need to learn is part four how not to describe sometimes people think they're setting the scene when what they're really doing is describing things that don't matter I was reading Choy and Young's xinchao sinchao and most of the story is set inside a house but honestly she barely describes it we get a passing mention of a fire a suede sofa and a bookshelf none of which are really memorable and that's because sometimes the setting doesn't matter that much especially because people can imagine ordinary places pretty damn well often even better than you could ever write them houses Parks a busy road even a castle or a satellite station you know if you're sitting doesn't deviate from what most people would imagine or the sense of place or detail just isn't that important then simply saying it was a house or a river or whatever might be enough in contrast though Yin Yong does describe the city that they're in once at the start and once at the end a small city called plown deserted buildings empty Parks men sitting around Street cast stops reeking of alcohol and this is followed by the city was much smaller than I remembered and had fallen into even deeper decline to the point of looking eerily deserted my old school had turned into a small Factory and a few old men were smoking in the backyard watching me absently my old home still stood in the same spot facing the park this meant to be this thematic comparison between the person she was as a child and the person she is as an adult and likewise with the city some things are the same some things are different the sitting has a deeper role to play here you know unlike with the house warranting further exploration and description maybe you want to use the setting to invoke feeling to explore character to create tension to explore themes and sometimes people withhold information about extraordinary places for effect too the city lies at the end of section of leaves that move through seas and continents and stretch into the vastness beyond the visible stars the city extends upwards and downwards in Preposterous arches and Chasm spanning Bridges this city is a vast complicated fascinating place that defies the laws of physics and this is basically all we get but it's intentional you know these details alone allow us to imagine the majesty and wonder of this place probably better than they could describe it even if all of our images will be different you know that feeling is the more important thing that imagination Beyond this description is often proportional to the role a place might play in the story and that means that a lot of the time you don't need to describe much at all if the location is only around for a paragraph or two if it doesn't feature a full scene or the point of what happens there is you know the psychology of the character of the prose and the detail of the setting isn't that important they don't interact with it and this leads to a problem that I've seen a lot and I I know that I did when I was younger characters might stop at a river for a night and the rider will take way too much time describing the river even though it's really not that important to the narrative all under the guise of setting the scene where that line is is hard to say and it's going to come down to your own personal style as well but okay let's be honest all right describing Halls of marble statues and flying castles is kind of easier you know they're fascinating on their own what about part 5 ordinary places the boring the monotonous the uninteresting the Suburban House the totally unremarkable Town beneath her the blue and white Terraces of the Arab Town overlapped one another splattered with the dark red spots of peppers drying in the sun kamu describes an ordinary town here but this uniquely specific detail of peppers drying in the sun makes it pop and contrasts the colors of red and green you know juxtaposing them with the blue and white of The Terraces I firmly believe that specificity can make just about anything interesting because you're always looking into the lives of people the inner workings of the world and nature around you that's fascinating even if the color of the door or the shape of the roof isn't little could have had Tove ditliveson describes cleaning some dishes in depression Lula stacked the dirty dishes on top of one another in nearly scalding water so parsley sprigs wilted lettuce leaves and radish tops released and floated on top in a add greasy stew which she appraised disgusted for a moment before she could bring herself to plunge her hands down into it and bring the porcelain out this isn't a sitting but the principle applies this is something very ordinary it's cleaning the dishes there's not even a unique character perspective here either and Ellison could have just written she cleaned the dishes in hot soapy water then left them to dry on the rack beside the sink but he didn't instead Tillerson focuses on specific details that evoke a specific feeling disgust nobody likes sticking their hands in grimy water with bits of food in it voila and describing it as a greasy stew word choice makes you gag there's a whole other experiential Dimension here I can't handle disgusting food stuff like this but the point is you know the lives of people are interesting Hilma Willits is today a woman went mad in the supermarket is just a great look at how to make the Monday same fascinating like literally one of the lines on the back says wulitzer insists in one gorgeous sentence after another there's no such thing as a usual hour let alone a usual day I mean the mundane can still be empty it can be pointless it can be infuriating it can be fruitful it can be lost it can be calming it can be chaotic it can be whatever it can be an experience there's this old writer's tale that readers often skip large paragraphs of description to get to the dialogue and there is some truth to that and that's because part 6 description can hurt the pacing I think when we're learning to write we tend to fall into this structure you know where we describe where the story is taking place we're sitting the scene and then we have dialogue or conflict and then there's some introspection you know our characters thinking at the end it's a natural structure to fall into it's kind of how we teach writing in English you know but one downside is that often describing here kind of stalls the pacing of the story story we stop we describe we move on vinay describo muvio Philip Pullman gets around this by interjecting a lot of character action in his description like there's several pages of will exploring the city in the subtle knife but it's littered with him engaging with those surroundings rather than describing them in the abstract this really intersects with the old rule show don't tell and I've done a whole video on that including where I talk about the times you know where you want to tell not show go watch that I do quite like that video and if you didn't know I've actually compiled all of my writing World building videos into an easy to read easy to reference book on writing and World building well two books volume one and volume two and they cover entirely different stuff because the videos came out at different times there are links to get them down below and if you only want to buy one then I suggest getting volume two it is better in that video we talked about using character emotions in more complex ways narratively you know blurring the lines between these beats of a story and we want to do the same with description letting characters interact is one way to give it momentum and blur the line between description and conflict but I want to go deeper than that the sheets were still folded from how hashiko got out of bed that morning for a moment mumi thought the pillows still bore the imprint of her small head after all it lay unmoved all this time on a diagonal the way hoshiko used to sleep legs folded either side so she could hug it and it could hug her back she stopped sucking her thumb when she was six though it took threatening braces and yeah that was from my novel three kinds of Silence it's currently out with beta readers and I want to take it to Publishers and we'll see where it goes but my book is about a young mum who has lost her child plus aliens but I made a conscious decision with my descriptions whenever I describe her surroundings particularly her house I wanted it to focus on her grief and memories I wanted there to be this constant sense that grief was a physical tangible place as much as mental that her grief was so woven into her surroundings that she couldn't escape it and kind of couldn't describe it without attaching it to those memories you know when she looks around she sees the past and you'll notice how quickly in just this paragraph she transitions from description to internal thoughts to reflect how quickly she spirals most of the descriptions we've looked at today have some degree of internalization even dialogue mixed in and I want to encourage you to experiment more with structuring this sort of thing to write passages where characters flit from location to location following the thoughts of a character prose that has you know momentary bits of dialogue where it fits instead of feeling bound to the structure of setting the scene characters talk and do things then we move on and rinse and repeat description isn't just setting the scene but interactions with the sitting can be the scene when you mix it in with some deeper introspection hopefully people don't skip over my descriptions because I wanted to really blend it in with the character beats and narrative Jeff enemy is Annihilation and again you're stuck with is probably my favorite example of this blending between description and introspection and character beats and conflicts and narrative and stuff because the whole book is about the Blurred Lines between ourselves and our environment and so I could barely find a paragraph where the description didn't somehow perfectly fit in with the character narrative it's fantastic read it it flawlessly segues from character beat to character beat and you have such a visceral understanding of this world because you know fundamentally description is a kind of exposition it's information about your world and so you can hide it in the same ways I've done videos on Exposition before but Terry Pratchett adds humor his to his descriptions while Stephen King adds tension about halfway down this fence Richie could see a monstrous Grove of sunflowers the tallest looked five feet taller more they had a bloated nasty look he didn't like a breeze rustled them and they seemed to nod together the boys are are here isn't that nice more boys are boys Richie shivered they looked up and down niebolt street the street was utterly deserted Richie could hear occasional cars passing on Route 2 but could not see them not only does King build up to the children coming here the story beat and that makes us curious about what this place is like but he gives a series of details which he seems to recognize aren't as important before he Narrows in on one specific detail that suggests this place is sick monstrous sentient and hungry through the sunflowers there's a promise of horrible things to come tension but Having learned all of this I think it's worth looking at an example of functional but not necessarily that compelling description in part 7 Brandon Sanderson once again I await my execution at the hands of the fantasy world but look okay Brando the Mando Sando is an incredibly prolific writer but he's not necessarily that well known for his elegant prose and I think we can look at some of his descriptions to see why as he walked he couldn't help noticing the banner flying above the camp it bore the same symbol in place another soldier's uniform coats a yellow glyph pair in the shape of a tower and a hammer on a field of deep green that was the banner of high Prince sadius ultimate ruler of caledon's own home District the soldiers took Caledon all the way around to the Northeast quarter of the camp a hike that took some time though the soul cast stone Barracks each looked exactly the same the rim of the camp was broken distinctively like ragged mountains old habits had him memorize the root here the Towering circular wall had been worn Away by countless High storms giving a clear view Eastward the northern edge of the field contained a sub Camp filled with several dozen barracks and at their Center a lumber yard filled with carpenters all of this description is stated very matter-of-factly like it's clear what Sanderson means at all times it's very practical writing but he doesn't narrow in on any specific details in a way that evoke a feeling or experience about this place and the details he does give are purely expositional or uninteresting when he notes things on his character's mind it's more of a fact than it is his perspective and I wouldn't say this in a particularly strong word choice here it gives us a sense of space but not much else it's functional but it's much less interesting than some of the other examples we've looked at today and I mean Brando the sandomando is a fantastic example of someone who knows how to construct stories that's where his real strength is like the structure of his character arcs and his worlds and how they all work together it's fantastic it really is and he's made so many compelling stories that people have fallen in love with you know like you can totally be all of that and 100 succeed like he has but there's nothing wrong with improving your description as well but I have created a whole companion video to this one where we can discuss even more like Terry Pratchett and why Hogwarts barely gets described and the totally not trauma advertising Story Bridge to Terabithia and I'm actually gonna show you the opening paragraph to my book and walk you through why I wrote the description like that what it means and hopefully show you how I kind of apply my own stuff you know it's part of my ongoing Beyond writing series over on nebula where I'm making a series to complement this one here four episodes up already nebula by the way is a platform that a bunch of us creators made ourselves so that we did not have to live under the threat of having our livelihoods taken away by giant corporations helps us be more independent we can make what we want and there's no ads curiosity stream though they have been super supportive in doing this they have helped nebula grow so so much and we've created a bundle where you get access to both of these amazing educational platforms you know they've got documentaries from David Attenborough and so so much more so if you want to support educational content like this then you can do so for basically nothing because it's 26 off right now at just 14.79 for all of this together down at the link below but let's bring this all together in a list of details and adjectives and nouns 1. the experience of a place is often more important than the details of it this can be the experience of a character or a place more generally which details might a character minimize emphasize or notice more 2. specific details are more Vivid and interesting than General statements figure out which details capture the experience be specific with your choice of nouns verbs and adjectives but don't exaggerate for effect three it's useful to describe things relevant to setup and payoff aspects that help us into place and interesting features of course describe whatever you want to four sometimes people need to learn when not to describe when the setting isn't relevant when the reader can imagine ordinary places or where you want to invite the reader to imagine 5. even ordinary places can be made interesting with specific tactile details that evoke feelings 6. consider how to blur the lines between description conflict and internalization to keep up the pace and make your Pros more interesting experiment with the different types of scenes that you might use in your story consider adding tension or humor your supreme leader Momo says stay nerdy and she will see you in the future foreign foreign\n",

      "dictators face a dilemma from North Korea simulated a nuclear attack being taken from the execution room to The Gallows [Music] imagine for a second you're a very beloved not at all propagandized dictator of a moderately sized but poor and undeveloped country and your neighbors are starting to get ahead of you militarily and economically and you cannot be left behind you might even want to be a nicer country the tourists actually want to come to and not see pop-up Villages full of paid actors well you've got to invest in your economy and Military don't you you've got to get people educated expand the government encourage private Enterprise and get other countries to invest in and trust in you but you wake up in a sweat in the middle of the night because an educated organized wealthier people with foreign connections and elaborate State institutions that don't entirely depend on you hasn't worked out that well for dictators in the past and it'd mean they're more capable of opposing you than they ever were before modernization is great until your country is so modern that you've suddenly been deposed with 23 Democratic stabs in the back democracy this is the problem facing North Korea and Kim Jong-un right now modernizing might be essential but it also might mean the end of your Dynasty modernizing might mean a revolution as part of my research for this video and to understand conflict and revolution in the real world I watched real-life laws modern conflict series covering things like the Yemen Civil War Afghanistan Isis have a euromaiden revolution led to what we're seeing in Russia and Ukraine now and you can watch all of that too over on nebula today's sponsor which you can check out with my link down in the description below thank you so much if you do part one the spark of Revolution look the dystopian why a revolution era is close and dear to my heart too but we all love to think that we're the chosen one Divergent other girl who escaped the ceremony to lead the revolution Against The Institute when we're probably not and revolutions don't work like that revolutions have complex causes and often for not great reasons and not in the ways we imagine a lot of revolutionary stories in fact the US military has published a whole bunch of stuff on this and highlights five things that create the circumstances of revolution proximates socioeconomic instability alienation Elite infighting international support and Injustice now the dictator's dilemma comes up so much in real world revolutions because modernizing creates all of this so it creates socioeconomic opportunity but it also highlights existing instability and leads to income inequality and it creates and empowers new factions in society that are not you the dictator these people are more socially mobile than before and not entirely dependent on the state and their interests are not necessarily aligned with yours North Korea has actually opened special economic zones to help their economy but it hasn't really done a huge amount and if North Korea allows people to leave for foreign businesses to invest then yeah it helps the economy but it also means Kim Jong-un doesn't have an iron grip on where the money is going and to whom lifting censorship helps with education and political participation but it also allows descent to spread which is exactly what happened in Egypt before Mubarak fell modern noising can also spark Elite infighting you know others who are currently in the inner Circles of power have every reason to try and stop a country liberalizing which is often what happens when it modernizes to take control themselves because they're seeing their slice of the pie shrink this is often the case of the military you know who helped keep the dictator in power for so long we've seen this thousands of times before right where powerful factions and an oppressive regime overthrow the current one but just take it over themselves and offer Democratic idealistic reasons though they'll often paint it that way after the fact you know oh oh we we overthrew the dictator and now we'll be the safeguards of the constitution for the next while till we can organize elections whenever that may be need I remind you that this is the map of the world that claims to be democracies it dictator opening up also allows foreign powers to exert more influence over the economy the People The Narrative to support factions of their choosing and that threatens your power base the only option in the end becomes repression if you want to hold on to power over time you alienate people more and more those who keep you in power and the people who want to get into the circles of power and suddenly Bingo it's Mormon time the dictated dilemma is just a one-way revolutions happen but it's a fast an example of why revolutions are just oh what's the word it's complicated let's take a look at these causes and five ways we can imagine a revolution when World building part two proximate socioeconomic instability when we write revolutions we tend to focus a lot on this last Point Injustice think of the death of Rue in The Hunger Games an innocent girl slaughtered at the hands of an oppressive regime sparking revolutions all across panim anger and Justice right it's a black and white narrative that's easily communicated that we as the audience can get behind that we can feel empowered by but the truth is Injustice tends to actually be a framework that gets attached to pre-existing socio-economic instability giving it momentum as shared vision and an easy message for a lot of people to get behind after all Injustice happens all the time in autocratic societies people are beaten and murdered and disappear off the face of the Earth and we don't see Rebellion at every turn of this especially the more and more that Injustice becomes normal every day accept it like the 2011 Egyptian revolution so the fall of Hosni Mubarak after three decades of power and though the narrative was a lot about police brutality and rights the long-term causes were really about economic instability income inequality stagnant wages huge debt youth unemployment which made daily life impossible for a lot of people what matters more are those first four factors and then the Injustice that comes out of them and this is by the way not just in individuals having inconsistent access to basic needs and opportunity but typically when communities are deprived of it or feeling exploited more and more as Time Marches On be it regions sectors of the economy age groups ethnic groups and so on and this is also the fiscal and social instability of the elites and the powerful not that they're like Starving in the streets but that they can't collect rent or taxes or suddenly other socially mobile groups are way more influential than them or they feel that their wealth and power isn't protected and they can't be guaranteed it could be taken away from them at any moment either by the dictator or the population you've got to win large groups of young people are unable to get a job there's that shared narrative because you yes you tanked the economy or if your local community your region is particularly affected and you organize around that but of of course lots of things cause instability War disease shifts in power new injustices the question is whether that anger can be directed away from the system so World War One introduced a ton of instability to European societies and in Russia that anger ended up directed at the tsar and the aristocracy and it did lead to Revolution in 1917 while Britain yeah there was some instability that led to like people demanding rights to vote a true shift in power but it also saw a huge rise in nationalistic further while in Russia everyone's like ah we're in the stupid War because of the Tsar Iran and Britain's like ah we're in this war because of why are we in this war well it's not the government Brian mcclellan's promise of blood highlights how militaries choosing not to fight for the state or turning on the state is pretty essential to a lot of revolutions and coups because militaries are nothing if not well organized machines and communities and if they as a community can be mobilized or demobilized then the foundations of the regime's power can be undone but let's focus on the first part of this cause proximate socio-economic instability because the reality is people don't necessarily respond to instability that they don't experience or they don't feel is kind of part of their Community their world and this can be because it affects a different part of the country or a different class to you or a different kind of people different infinite group to you instead it becomes you know these euphemistic descriptions of regional agricultural problems when they're starving to death or violent thugs terrorizing the streets after they've just been massacred by the police recently although de-radicalizing terrorists when they're putting children into concentration camps to eradicate their culture the thing is all autocratic systems still need to make the factions keeping them in power happy be it the Nobles the military the rich the church and even to some extent the working population you know you've got to have someone working for you some regions or factions might be insulated because of this from certain kinds of instability to keep them more loyal to the government if you can make sure that the people producing your oil are happy and you can sell that oil to other countries well you'll be perfectly fine for the most part and this can lead to really interesting World building quirks where like okay Thailand and turkey have a flawed democracy where the military will intervene if they don't like the outcome they've done that historically so even these semi-democrat Credit Systems have to placate the military it's interesting The Hunger Games adapts this to its World building too so the capital gives special privileges to districts one and two even though they're subordinate even though they start to participate in the games because it creates a buffer zone between them and the other districts and because this is where a lot of their military is drawn from it's what keeps them in power so we can see this connection between how the state insulates certain groups of people from socioeconomic instability and Injustice and how they keep themselves in power but take that away and you get what we saw in 1984 in the Philippines dictator Ferdinand Marcos sent a tank Battalion to crush a supposed Revolt but when they were met with nuns kneeling with rosaries and children offering the soldiers food and water the soldiers refused to fight over 80 percent of the military defected and this immediately led to the fall of Marcus's regime so one way you can think of revolutions it's not just in terms of Injustice or ideology but in terms of proximate socio-economic instability that changes the relationships that communities have with those in power and the foundations of that power figuring out how that is eroded through the changes in these relationships figure out who is going to be more loyal to the regime as it is and what kind of instability Injustice or circumstances could change that right inconsistent pension payments being repeatedly overlooked for cabinet positions being forced to kill peaceful protesters one thing to note is that instability does not necessarily mean everyone's getting poorer or worse off it often does but income inequality is one of those things we mentioned in the dictator's dilemma the sense that there's a whole group of people getting way better off and a whole lot of people that aren't it's also the sense that your way of life the way things have been is being really disrupted and you don't feel safe and secure and this is both at the elite level and the porous level like the industrial revolution saw a huge economic growth all across Europe and the emergence of a class of wealthier people but that rapid shift also introduced instability disruption and undermined communities and forced migration it saw the intensification of colonial repression across the world instability is just as much about the sense of your life being in flux and a feeling of change outside of your control and this period was also fertile ground for revolutionary sentiment challenging existing power structures the way things have worked it lead to the age of Revolution America France Serbia Spain Italy Greece Belgium Haiti the Netherlands Poland all across Latin America exploding in Revolution and then again in 1848 as one this wealthier class demanded more concessions more rights more power as they grew with this instability and two working conditions for the poor got even worse you know the children meant to be learning for the minds and whatever but work was unstable and that sentiment could be harnessed that uneven economic development is actually really important as a cause this is actually a Hallmark of the emerging Flintlock fantasy genre which centers a lot on Revolution like a Django wixler's the thousand names you know it looks at the economic disparity that emerges in response to these revolutionary Technologies and also I think it's really interesting that that's coming out now in the modern day when income inequality and so on is a huge element of the political discussions that we have you're seeing those same sentiments coming out in the fiction that we discuss and write so if you want to incorporate that into your word building you know there's there's commentary there communities with New Wealth can motivate political change because they feel the old system doesn't really serve them and that is what happens when an dictator tries to modernize so you're looking at both people being better off and worse off and the contrast between them this is also something we see in cyberpunk stories now which again are seeing a Resurgence where the Uber Rich want to overthrow democracy and the poor want to overthrow them part three Injustice just like anger for socioeconomic instability can be directed outwards away from the regime so can Injustice including back at the victims themselves you've seen this a thousand times before with a innocent protesters being shot or with a radical Rebels and citing violence in our streets our enemy is an Insidious one seem to divide us uighur Muslims are famously in detention camps in China right now to supposedly combat quote religious extremism a narrative that a lot of people in China buy into because of how the state has framed this Injustice and they've done similar things to Tibetan culture in the past as well ethnic religious Regional lines can be powerful narratives to justify repression and sources of community instability and Injustice that in turn motivate Revolt Children of Men has one of the most horrific and grounded depictions of this kind of instability and though it frames it more as societal collapse than Revolution it could easily turn out that way of course one thing that is often ignored in fiction is that revolutions introduce instability and Injustice to a region like Studies have shown that if Rebels are the ones who are bombing your area causing gunfire fights in the streets you probably think that they're the source of the instability and you're more likely to side with the regime killing a few uppity protesters here and there isn't the worst Injustice compared to your neighbor getting shot and mauled to death three weeks ago especially because revolutions are going to Target logistical centers government buildings Bridges Railways all of which are manned and used by everyday civilians makes their life hell as well so when we're building people might turn against the Revolutionary cause if they feel like their lives are being torn apart For No Good Reason by them even if the cause is a good one so in that way it is about controlling the narrative who is the oppressor and who is the oppressed one detail I really like in Legend of Korra is how tala cracks down on non-benders in the face of this equalist revolution aiming to supposedly remove binders entirely non-benders weren't necessarily behind them on at this point they kind of viewed him as the source of instability the one who was causing these terrorist attacks until this happened until these policies came into force in which case their indignation turned against tarlock a bending government regime councilman and Benders more broadly empowering the equalis and leading to a bigger Revolution it's pretty compelling to feel the people are always going to fight for what's right but the reality is people can become the targets of revolutions without necessarily doing much wrong and that can change how it's viewed how the story of the revolution is told how the events are recounted around the country so this is a second way you can World build revolutions as a chain or perception of injustices who would different factions realistically blame for what is going on especially during the lead-up to Revolution who would buy into which narratives who would spread which narratives and how does injustice intersect with a community pre-existing instabilities and problems part 4 alienation being alienated from a national communities institutions the legal social cultural political is a really powerful motivator because suddenly you feel outside the system you don't feel part of it you don't think you should respect it you think you should change it and this is again for the privileged and the underprivileged and we've seen the latter do this like dozens of times right 1954 for Vietnam and the French Algeria did the same in 1962 1949 so Indonesia free itself of Dutch roll Zimbabwe in 1979 from British rule Colonial Powers alienated the people they were governing and actively repressed to them alienation is why so many revolutions or partition movements have been down religious or ethnic lines hoping to carve out a section of a country for that one group who don't feel part of the system rebelling against the government and doing so like the 1959 Tibetan Uprising against China but it's also down class and cultural Lines within a country like the many communist Revolutions of the 20th century are the best examples right but groups in your world might be defined by other things by the type of magic they use by their role in history all sorts the point is you're still looking for how communities of people are alienated from the centers of power in all of these cases a regional dialectal ethnic religious community is being either erased or severely disadvantaged or excluded from the system cut out of it so that their problems can't be fixed within it and so Revolution becomes the answer so again you're wanting to look for what problems are they needing solved that aren't being addressed and will never be addressed the OPA and James you say Corey's the expense takes this and runs with it the belters live out on the asteroid belt in this kind of semi-nomadic life but I mean they've felt ignored and exploited by Mars and Earth for resources and turn to Revolution in because they have been cut out of the systems of power they're seen as pawns their identity is not accommodated for and much of the series is dedicated to them trying to find recourse inside the system and when that doesn't work then secession is the only answer but this also means that if the regime can convince people that there will be recourse inside the system then they won't feel alienated not as much instead there might be some paper-thin concessions and you'll often see that there's a history of concessions being given or deals being made and then broken and then redone and eventually people lose Faith a big part of growing alienation is also demographic change a rapidly growing ethnic groups or a huge generational group of young people you know appearing elsewise these all create a sense of instability and a need for change uh alienated by an older system that wasn't necessarily built for them but critically okay critically it is just as important if not more so to figure out when the privileged factions within Society feel alienated or unjustly excluded pour them from the circles of power they are the ones with the money and the power to kick-start something they're equally just as often a squabble between the Elites for not getting what they want like we saw this in Russia just a few weeks ago the Wagner group a private military organization that fights for Russia led by a dude called pregosian uh attempted what was basically a coup against Putin and the higher defense Ministry officials but they framed it of course they framed it as a March for justice uh when it was really just a power struggle between the Russian Elite circles because pregosian kind of hated the defense minister Shogun wanted someone else in power he's been criticizing him for months he he thinks he does it better than all of the Russian military officials pagosian is not a good guy but people seemed to welcome him because of the framing that they gave it Robert's rebellion in George R Martin's A Song of Ice and Fire is that Mythic Revolution with a noble Lords overthrew the Mad King who was burning people alive there's the Injustice but it also turned on alienation so Tywin Lannister betrayed the Mad King at the last moment Rising up in Revolution with Robert partly because he knew he had to do this if he wanted to stay within the circles of Robert's new regime but he actually already felt alienated from the circles of the Mad King's power after serving loyally for years and being spited for it Tywin Lannister was opportunistic here because the Mad King took Jaime his one ear and made him a kingsguard so he couldn't have a kid this Elite infighting is in one way kanawat brought the Mad King down and alienation by the way doesn't need to be active repression doesn't need to be police totality in the streets you know beating people down and shooting them in executions in public it can be cultural exclusion you know the sense that a country tells a group of people an ethnic group or a religious group you are not who we are and so we don't accommodate for you inside the system or there might be a region that's been left behind economically that the government just doesn't care for that can be a really powerful feeling of alienation that your problems just aren't being addressed and that can turn into more revolutionary sentiment there's often this huge divide in the lead-up to Revolution over working to change the system from within versus changing the system with Revolution what pushes one group in your Society or the other into the latter it's radical right that alienation has to be Stark enough so this is a third way to think about Revolution how underprivileged communities are progressively passively or actively alienated or repressed by the regime and how privileged communities feel alienated from the levels of power and seek to change that by force how would these two feelings Collide because you gotta often have them at the same time that's where this revolution Sparks right one of them's the matchbox and one of them's the match stick part 5 community and Elite infighting we've talked a little bit about this in alienation but Elite infighting matters because of organizational capacity the reason revolutions spring up around communities is that communities can be organized unions churches the military local governments all of these have pre-existing structures that make it easier to organize resources and movements and troops and ideas and Elites are the people in power who have connections and organizational capacity and wealth and influence to mobilize these communities hell Lenin was upper middle class half the students who Rebel in Les Mis are from noble families they've got time to be idealistic that growing middle class gives people to do more than suffered down in the mines for pennies every day figure out what gives Revolution its organizational capacity because it can't just spring out of nowhere and how do the interests of these different groups connect because they might not have the same priorities just the same end game the regime Must Fall Margaret Edwards books the handmaid's tale and the Testaments have Revolution kind of as an afterthought they're in the background but one of the most interesting parts of these books is they have these kind of like epilogue chapters where there's a PR a professor giving like a lecture on Gilead history speculating about how it fell and the politics of it and kind of a sociological commentary really and it's actually a really insightful read for World building autocratic societies how they both maintain themselves when they're around how unstable they really are and how they eventually collapse how that all of that of course is inevitably going to happen she focuses though on purges within the a system within the higher-ups that Elite infighting the release of this information touched off the so-called Bal Purge the finned the ranks of the Elite Class weakened the regime and instigated a military push as well as a popular Revolt the Civil strife and Chaos that resulted enabled a campaign coordinated by the MayDay resistance and a series of successful attacks by those resentful of the massacre of the Mormons and she returns to this idea of The Purge over and over the elites hanging each other for immorality or violating the Gilead code Mayday the resistance is actually portrayed as kinda helpless until the elites turn on each other enough until there's enough instability in their ranks in the first place there's even a focus on Injustice here that gives the revolution a narrative you know uniting them people don't quite realize how powerful states are and how difficult Revolution really is if you're just going up against a fully fledged state power even a dictatorship you know it's why cracks within the actual regime are so important a lot of the time we see that breakdown of social relations in Gilead over the two books and proximate socioeconomic instability is just a constant backdrop for the story how expensive food is how everything's rationed out the simple pleasure of a hot egg the TV series which is okay for the most part actually explores the dictator's dilemma in Gilead as well one Commander wants Gilead to liberalize and open up to improve the economy and have fewer human rights abuses by creating a new city for people to live more freely and a little outside their censorship this is all in hopes of alleviating International pressure getting International Aid and undermine the rebels that they're constantly fighting you know because if they can say hey this is an incredibly unjust place to live in because they can point to the city and say hey there's not all these injustices that you're saying but it also creates a bid for resistance and free thought other factions in Gilead sees on this though as supposed weakness sparking more in fighting and purges foreshadowing what is to come this is a fourth way to think about World building revolutions about the competing interests of the Elites in ideological differences or social economic or religious policy and all of this brings out other instabilities injustices and causes alienation within the ranks and eventually align some of them with revolutionary interests part 6 international support did you know the CIA had a manual on how to assassinate politicians as part of fostering Rebellion it's called the study of assassination and it included how to select targets which methods are most effective and what the hell to do if it all goes wrong including admitting that assassination orders should never be committed to records or paper of course I asked the CIA and they've never used it which is really good because I was worried for a second but if they did you could really imagine how International interference could really undermine the regime and Foster chaos in the ranks weakening the regime to other pressures see if you can't feed your soldiers communicate your movements organize strikes and uprisings or arm them resupply them then having a righteous cause isn't going anywhere Logistics are way more important than any righteous cause or determination you might have I actually quite like the new series and or for this over and over the Rebellion just fails and the Empire is just basically one step ahead and we get this real sense that putting together the organizational capacity is the bigger challenge of rebellion the Empire on the other hand is just this logistical Behemoth it's no wonder that one-on-one and wins every single time assassinations make Logistics Harder by fostering infighting and oppressive systems and removing links in a chain but the reason international support is so important to Revolutions is that much like Elites foreign powers can fund arm and supply people in another country which I mean I haven't checked it but I assume that always turns out well in fact I can't even imagine any bad consequences coming from that a terror group Isis attacking a prison facility in Syria but you've got to wonder right this mind-boggling question why why spend all these resources to just give them to another country to a revolutionary force that might not even win well the US military has written about that as well and they talk about funding insurgencies first as a tool of disruption to isolate destabilize or undermine the Authority or legitimacy of a hostile government by disrupting their assets resources military capabilities economic Warfare right the publication speaks of one attempt to disrupt Soviet Supply and oil lines in the 50s by assisting the Romanian peasants party uh it failed in fact if if you read the publication you see that the U.S failed a lot almost universally to a Darkly comedic level but the point is they tried and you get points for that right Germany didn't send Lenin back to Russia during World War one because they thought Russia deserved to give communism a shot but because it could help Russia revolt and get them out of the war in fact it got them one of the most brutal treaties in Europe the Treaty of Barista fosk which gave them all of this land oh goodness could you could you imagine could you imagine if Germany was made to sign like a like a treaty that was as bad as that for him God I mean that would that would have some consequences I assume they talk about international support as a tool of coercion you know forcing a government into concessions or a change in policy you know this can be to coerce access to resources or trade deal to make them do something in the region sometimes backing someone that they think will actually give them a better deal it's kind of like a threat and thirdly international support is a tool of regime change which again I assume just always goes well to create a quote more ideologically favorable Ally this can be mixed in with the promise of Liberation and even if partly true historically countries have interests as well trade deals International hegemony influence and power basically it's not always out of the goodness of their heart this is a fifth way to Envision World building Revolution what do other countries want what do their neighbors want how would their support shape the revolution its policies its successes its losses and the world that comes after the iron bank in Brown of us in A Song of Ice and Fire is a great example of this kind of World building they lend money to countries or states and if the state doesn't pay them back they fund revolutions against them and they give money to people who do promise to pay it back in A Dance with Dragons they agree to support Stannis for the Iron Throne a man famous for keeping his word after Robert's Rule put the crown in millions in death that they never intend to really pay back that's using Civil War as a tool of coercion and regime change on the other hand in the expanse Mars enters into an uneasy short-term alliance with the OPA to at least undermine Earth's axis to asteroid resources and give them leverage there's disruption and coercion on the other hand neighboring countries might consider opposing revolutionary efforts and supporting and even autocratic regime no matter how bad they are or how righteous the revolution really is because they don't want an unstable war-torn neighbor who who they need to trade with or depend on economically currently Sudan is heading for a civil war between two rival Elite factions Libya has picked a side with the rsf but mostly because of the economic and Military ties they have with the rsf regime more than any righteous reasons it'll help Olivia's own dictator stay in power as well on the other hand Egypt actually more naturally aligns with the saf but has to play pretty safe because of how economically dependent they are on the network of allies connected to the rsf which signs your neighboring country's full on is not just a moral choice all of this is why dictators are so often reluctant to allow International influence in their countries in their Arena even you know because it tends to end up with coercion disruption and potentially regime change so one answer to the dictator's dilemma is they band together in a fellowship of police brutality they have this rational Mutual survival interest China might intervene to stop a revolution North Korea not because they love the way the country is currently run but because they don't want an ideologically opposed State on their border there while the US might fund a revolution there for geopolitical reasons in the same way that they have in the past other places part 7 Breaking Point okay so you're a very beloved not at all propagandized dictator of a moderately sized but poor country you tried to modernize and now you've got some growth but you've also got some growing income inequality and you've highlighted a lot of pre-existing economic instability you've alienated your allies in the military who now want you gone and are blaming you for all of the atrocities they helped you out with anyway the poor feel you aren't addressing their problems and have a right to say something now stupid poor people and other countries are now cutting deals with other factions for oil supplies or a shift in Economic Policy what do you do the way you used to solve problems in the past which was mostly by shooting people isn't working so much anymore concessions Aren't Enough punishments only spur on Revolt resistance takes longer and longer to put down and sometimes it doesn't get put down at all sending in the military is less reliable there's less money for you to pay people off economic measures don't stop spiraling you stop censoring the press and the internet but that just spreads the revolutionary ideas even more suddenly you're sitting on a throne of newspaper and a lot of people have matches in their hands think about how your regime has maintained order and solved problems in the past with bribes with the military with spies and manipulation or concessions and why do those methods stop working so much anymore why are they working less and less and you've got to think about by the way all of these causes in terms of them being structural so long term and immediate you know something that actually Sparks that people respond to emotionally that gets them involved it gets things going short term and long term revolutions might happen overnight but they ferment for years and they have multiple causes multiple reasons multiple historical readings that you can look back on there's no one definitive explanation that's what I'm trying to get across with all of this great world building means your world can be explained in multiple ways revolutions are Brewing all over the real world and the horrors we're seeing right now in Russia and Ukraine are deeply connected to the Ukrainian revolution of dignity in 2013 as well as the revolts funded by Russia in Donetsk and luhansk for geopolitical reasons which they frame wrongly as revolutions against an oppressive power but are really about Russian expansionism and I think it'd be really useful for you to learn more about that in real life laws video on Russia and Ukraine before 2022. it's a fascinating look at how complex revolutions can be and you can learn a lot for your world building that video is available at the link down below over on nebula see us creators we are nebula yep us this person and a whole bunch of others and given how I just made a video on how AI is working its way into creative spaces I would love you to support us as human individuals the Russian Ukraine video is part of a whole series called modern conflicts and nebula also comes with a nebula classes now like Tony Sandos is one on a video editing videos just like this if you want to give YouTube a shot yourself and you can check all those videos out by using my link for 40 off new build for an entire year cheapest chips down at the link in the description below uh and using my link does help a lot because it helps me specifically thank you very much it will mean a lot and I think you'll get a lot out of it but let's bring all of this together in a revolutionary summary one revolutions can be interpreted as a pattern and response to socioeconomic instability changing relationships between communities and those in power eroding the foundations of their power over time who would be more loyal to the regime and what would shift that relationship two revolutions can be read as a pattern and response to Injustice interceding with socioeconomic instabilities who would communities blame especially as the revolution introduces more injustices and instability three alienation is a powerful force and Revolution be it down ethnic religious or other lines or alienation from the circles of power for the elites this can be through passive policy making cultural norms or active repression 4. Elite infighting and international support is fundamental to mobilizing and logistical management as well as weakening the existing regime how do these interests Collide and with what instabilities what do neighboring countries want 5. identify the long-term structural causes of the Revolution and the immediate transient ones that set it off all of these causes create an unstable equilibrium where the usual ways of dealing with social problems and no longer as effective stay noted my friends and if you haven't got it yet go get on running World building Volume 2 because volume 3 is coming at the end of the year oh uh and I'll see you in the future that's right I have catch phrases I have to say foreign\n",
      "ZeWOdF3deZI\n",
      "look at this cork board stories Can Be Imagined like a bunch of points all connected by string pulling on each other tugging because characters and objects and places they're all connected they all relate to each other in some way creating tension as events unfold and and characters pull in different directions till eventually something snaps something breaks and A revolution is perfect for this kind of makeup you've got characters on opposite sides the regime versus the resistance but maybe you've got characters who believe in the regime and that it can be changed from within While others demand more radical methods I'm using hijack Peter you've got characters disagreeing over revolutionary methods and then everyone agrees on bringing down the regime but not what comes after a symbolic Hunger Games historically revolutions haven't always been a unified front of ideologies but often a tangled mess of the rich wanting power or workers wanting rights and Liberation uh foreign countries wanting concessions and agreements of politicians and Elites wanting more control of the system ideologues you know having visions of the future that are going to be difficult if not impossible to implement and maybe all the strings between these things are loose while they're fighting the regime while they have a common goal but once that's over these strings are going to get Tighter and Tighter and Tighter till eventually you've got your characters pulling in a thousand different directions and something comes apart so let's talk about revolutions [Music] foreign [Music] guess who's sponsoring this video me I am because all of you mean that I don't need anyone else for this video because I took all of the discussions we've had around writing and word building and put them into these easy to read easy to reference expanded on writing and World building books with thousands of extra words worth of detail and Analysis volume 1 and volume 2 are entirely different from one another and guess what volume 3 is coming later this year that's why you guys have been voting on the covers I love having all of you involved if you like these kind of discussions and haven't got them yet then I'd love for you to pick them up at the link down in the description below but I'm also an author I've been publishing fiction and poems with magazines for quite a while now and I would love to share them with you if you want to read some of my work they are linked down in the description below as well thank you for making so that I can sponsor my videos with my own work see I've been doing all these books and stories and revolution is a Trope right it's not a story by itself and when we're writing stories of Revolution we're really telling stories about struggle sacrifice Injustice in society how to organize ourselves wealth and power why people fight the exploration of feminine agency cycles of history the shape of tyranny and dangers of ideological utopian Pursuit and what the revolution is really about comes through in the story web you make where these threads of tension pull your characters is what your story is about Les Miserables which is not about the French Revolution but the 1832 June Rebellion is my favorite musical and it's not just about Revolution right you've got Valjean trying to redeem himself and pursuing him with this black and white morality asking what Justice Means and how the law can be unjust all coming to head when they confront each other and Belgian doesn't kill him and javer is left asking why what reason does he have to spare me is this tension between you know theme what jivia believes about the world this black and white morality and what Jean Valjean does in the story and it stretches and stretches till it gets too much and foreign snaps then there's all these characters stuck and squalor like Fontaine and eponine trying to get out but unable to till that eventually kills them too pulling these strings in such a way to expose how classism locks people into positions in life then when the revolution comes along and all of them die basically and pointlessly and achieve nothing empty chairs and it's because the stories about the gap between ideology and reality and how we can get caught up in it like Javier who was left questioning whether the criminals might actually have a point but if they do have a point then I'm the criminal and in the end the poor die because of rich people's greed and grante Aaron and harlas disagreeing on how to handle the revolution that's them pulling pulling these characters going in different directions then dying together this web is the Revolutionary story of Les Miserables it's what gives meaning to the story and it's why it hits home because it keeps stretching those things till eventually it snaps and we spend all this time in the story weaving these strings so we know where the emphasis and point of it is if you want your Revolution your story to explore something it has to come out here you know and importantly you actually may not realize what your story is exploring right let me explain how like part of the reason that some revolutionary why a dystopian novels kind of fall flat is that so many of their strings all return to basically a love triangle right or some other kind of like into character drama that doesn't have a huge amount to do with the themes that they were supposedly discussing these sort of triangles were often shallow but so much time was spent on them so many things were dependent on this point of tension connect to it via these strings that that was the point of the door that was a New Zealand accent would that was the point of the story look at what you're actually putting time into in your story what you're showing the reader what you're foreshadowing where the tension actually is because that's what your story will become no matter what you tell us a little scene at the end over in the corner here not really connected to the center with only a little tiny pluck the reverberations of which aren't felt throughout the rest of it well that matters less when you spend all of your time I'm stretching these plot points over here it's hard to talk about War and Peace of the same breath as divergent but we will and we're also going to talk about why the Hunger Games keeps getting better with time part one Injustice alienation and Desperation a lot of Revolution focused stories start one of two ways and this is not to say it's realistic but these are the story Frameworks we tend to return to over and over we find compelling one the 1984 way someone inside the system realizes the system is broken and wants to bring it down usually realizing a lot of what they've believed is a lie or two The Hunger Games someone disenfranchised by the system gets wrapped up in a revolution to bring it down But whichever it is I found that a lot of these stories the best ones really grounded themselves viscerally in those three things Injustice alienation and Desperation common reasons for people to join a cause Les Miserables shows Jean Valjean suffering at the iniquity of the justice system fontaine's desperation to give her a child being forced to sell herself in her here for pennies and there's this whole underclass of society who have been constantly alienated by the system for years and when you feel outside the system when you feel that your problems cannot be solved inside it there's this realization that you are not incorporated into the system then you have every motivation to change it simply telling me help help I'm being repressed but not show me how it affects people on a day-by-day level just doesn't work as well on a line by line level you've got to work at capturing emotions like desperation so have a listen to this from cormet McCarthy in the morning they went on desolate country a bar had nailed to a barn door ratty wisp of a tail inside the bar and three bodies hanging from the rafters dried and Dusty among the one slats of light there could be something here the boy said there could be some corn or something let's go the man said mostly award about their shoes that and food always food in an old badboard Smokehouse they found a ham gambled up in a high corner it looked like something fetched from a tomb so dried and drawn he cut into it with his knife deep red and salty meat inside rich and good they fried it that night over their fire thick slices of it and put the slices to simmer with a tin of beans McCarthy's writing is incredibly evocative he spends no time dwelling on any single instance of desperation because there is no time to feel it for these people as soon as we read one problem another is found only if they're horrifically disturbing images to be dropped in the middle a normal everyday thing for them stopping only to dwell on the food they find this is showing us hunger and Desperation from our character's perspective where their mind is really at where they have the bandwidth to think there's the Simplicity to his writing that doesn't even leave room for the normal horror you would feel this sort of writing helped helps us understand why change needs to happen now this is not a revolution story but this sort of writing could definitely appear in it you know those same feelings are being channeled it helps us understand the stakes that are at hand for the characters on a very personal everyday level and that is really important all the time one of the reasons a lot of why a dystopian Revolution stories don't work that well is because the Injustice or alienation just wasn't that convincing or it was really contrived because we're left asking who would even organize a society like this what is the point of it you're telling me that everyone has to wear a mask based on the size of their toes why whereas I know exactly what the Injustice is in a world like Les Miserables how that comes to be it channels familiar angers and feelings the scenes of Injustice desperation and alienation are often the inciting incident and these sorts of stories because they give characters on tense emotions that motivate them to act now again this is really about Revolution stories where our main character is the boss who's gonna go and you know fight it all out right the handmaid's tale is kind of an antidote to a lot of revolutionary writing and dystopian writing Alfred is the object of alienation Injustice and repression but Revolution isn't really presented as an option because the other side of revolutionary stories right you've got the stories where people rise up but the other side is stories of repression and the experiences of those under it of the victims Revolution happens around Alfred but she is not an agent in it lack of autonomy and choice is fundamental to the themes of the story to understanding what it means to be repressed and why Revolution is not an option for so many Edward's writing is full of Genius little turns of phrase that capture offer its desire to Rebel but inability to feel she can because of course we love to think that we would Rebel and we would fight for what's right that we are not offered but a lot of us would be and a really compelling way to explore the desperation and alienation and effects of your regime is to show why people don't Rebel put this in your story web and then you've got Alfred story narrowing in on her conflicts with a Serena Joy talking about how women are pitted against each other in in patriarchal systems put all these together and you've got a really tight bit of tension for why revolutions might be something that other people do that you just don't have the bandwidth for it exposes the optimistic hope that everyone can stand up for what they believe in when they can't part two Revolution as character arcs cataracts are the lenses through which we understand the tropes of our story and spoilers by the way for Dune and the full series skip to this point if you don't want to see them but it is actually a revolutionary story about the dangers of following radical Chosen One Messianic leaders even with the admirable goal of overthrowing the Imperial corrupt system Paula trades becomes a religious zealot consolidating power in himself and taking a marginalized group The Freeman and turning them into a conquering Force he got some fantastic Charisma rolls and is using them for all the wrong reasons Liberation easily becomes repression when you ruling becomes inevitably better than your enemy and so a tradis's desire for justice and peace and and forging the empire together into something better this desperation turns into something horrible utopian Visions can Galvanize a movement but they can also justify atrocities Paul's negative character Arc has slowed descent into tyranny shapes the meaning of the Revolution and the impact the story leaves on us it's a filter for us to understand and think about Revolution as a theme and as a real force in the world consider how your characters change across the story and how their change colors the meaning of revolution thematically positive arcs where characters grow into their heroism and learn the importance of individual action and societal change matter but War and Peace sees Natasha rastava start out with a romanticized view of the French Revolution till eventually she becomes more and more disillusioned and loses her innocence and understands the brutality of a revolution of the violence it entails that ideas and heroism and belief aren't enough and they're also not what is put through the fires of War but I hear you say but my Lord I object not all revolutionary stories say that and I would say correct young man see you've got to think about what conflict the characters actually face and what that says about the revolution just like how how the characters change will color the meaning of revolution right this is the framing of the revolution is pretty optimistic it's about a marginalized people rising up for Liberty equality and fraternity the main obstacle Eevee Encounters in the story is when V basically kidnaps and prisons and torches her to harden her into a revolutionary who never gives up I know that sounds bad it is bad you could call him an anti-hero it takes up a significant part of the plot but while she's imprisoned she is given these letters about the life of two women in love before the autocracy kicked in there's this juxtaposition of the dark reality she now faces and the colorful life this other girl lived and it gives Evie something to cling to so that she never gives in but the reason the story doesn't focus on how a revolution could be corrupted or the true violence required and how dark and and brutal it really is is because the story is so much more about the importance of individual action of sacrifice and individual resistance and The Virtue that is found in that it's about empathy for others there's an optimistic view of the world and Human Action in that the revolution isn't one with a bloody war and ugly consequences it's one with individual action the choices of one per person at a time human empathy those are the forces that overcome Injustice and alienation and Desperation that's the Thematic messaging of the film in The Hunger Games Candace and Peter have to contend with the power of a media narrative and propaganda how it frames The Narrative of Injustice in the world and in turn how it can be used to spark Revolution one of the things that I actually keep coming back to that I really appreciate in the series is how it frames the illegitimate anger of the oppressed that is mahogany that oppressed peoples are not allowed to exhibit anger and rage and Desperation because it's not polite it's not good Society manners you know and the rich and the powerful use that as an excuse to dismiss your concerns well if you're not going to be reasonable to talk about oh well I'm not going to listen am I this is sometimes called respectability politics so Peter understanding this figuring this out he rolled high on Deception pulls out an Ace card if it weren't for the baby this is something that does play by those rules but because of how Collins chose to present Revolution because of the obstacles to it that she gave Katniss and Peter we see how the poor and marginalized are forced to refine themselves for the rich and Powerful Revolution is about controlling a message you know the regime wants to convince people that these are just thugs destroying the streets and all that right but the revolution wants people to believe that they are a just Fighters fighting for Liberation and then there's character conflict on top of this stories thrive on failure we all know this they're what make the eventual successes meaningful right Candace failing to save her sister Prim in the end in the final book after volunteering to protect her in the first is a great subversion I I really like that because it brings her into conflict with Gail someone who played a role in the bombs that did kill her in the end there's this horrific redundancy to the revolution that says a lot manifesting realities about your revolution in character conflicts with real consequences brings it down to earth and you might be saying ah yes the love triangle at the heart of The Hunger Game string Gail and Peter and Kenneth but not really like that's there technically but it's really quite secondary and the conflict between the characters isn't so much about like them falling out of love or anything like that it's about disagreements over methods of Revolution and the conflicts that come out of that and the redundancy of her decision in the first book so Gail's character Arc of joining the revolution ties into Katniss's decision at the beginning which ties into the themes of the story and how as President Snow is not wasteful in his character development it's all very connected in an interesting way so yeah maybe two characters disagree on methods and that drives a wedge between between them or it even leads to betrayal maybe they disagree on what Society should look like after the revolution or their experiences in the war drive them apart with one becoming cynical and the other remaining an optimist or being inflicted with PTSD Revolution gives the opportunity for a ton of fascinating character Dynamics the leader faced with moral dilemmas the follower getting disillusioned the noble confronting their role in the horrors of before the Optimus made cynical the afraid turned hero so to bring it back to our story web it's not just about where these strings go and kind of how different things connect but how they change over time how different points of tension become related to certain characters or scenes or or plot points as characters change and it changes the nature of all that pulling because part of a story part of what makes it interesting is that the stuff that drives the story at the beginning the tensions that are there at the start are not necessarily the ones at the end a character might start out loyal to their Homeland but slowly become disgusted by it those strings changing right or the strings might stay the same throughout the book but grow more complex deeper and full of knots they're loyal to their country but they have to question who and what they're loyal to exactly is it the ideals the government or the people one figure out the strings of tension where they go and start and two figure out how they change how they grow more tense and where they get redirected then look at the meaning your readers will derive from this if you want your story to say something it'll come from the scenes that have the most time from the character conflict that you spend time on part three do revolutions need to be realistic writing revolutions is hard right because it is easy to dramatize Injustice and personal vendettas think the innocent girl shot by the police state a black and white narrative but less so Collective action and Logistics and international support even though I've find all of those fascinating all of which are fundamental to realistic revolutions go check out my video on on World building them in the dictator's dilemma that is a lot of information you'll find relevant collectively studies kind of point out these five things are critical to realistic revolutions and though Injustice is one of them Injustice tends to actually be a moral framework that gets attached to pre-existing Community instability economic social political with instability and opportunity being a far bigger motivator and often not for great reasons you know see Wagner's weird-ass coup that happened in Russia recently and then there's the question of what the hell is injustice people are going to disagree and you've seen how easy it is to convince large groups of people that someone deserved to be shot by the police because that is something that people believe for some reason Studies have shown villages in Vietnam were more likely to support once side or the other during the Civil War depending on whoever happened to be bombing them which you know fear we get caught up in ideological motivations when we're writing stories like this but most people just want to grill revolutions are a storm of complex factors that all come crashing together at once where pre-existing instability means choosing now between two different types of instability the status quo or the revolution but okay this is a big point for me and it's the point that you see in so many stories revolutions don't have to be realistic you don't need to get fixated on that they can be Mythic and inspiring and optimistic and they can use the aesthetic of Revolution or dystopia to talk about other things 1984 is a ridiculous world it is absurd it is baffling it doesn't make any sense it never made any sense that's the point of it right but that is intentional stories like Arcane or snow crash or Star Wars are meant to be Mythic and hopeful and legendary even if they explore real world things like sacrifice and found family and loyalty well snow crashes meant to be a horrifying and bizarre projection of human weirdness these are still stories about people in Revolt they can still be compelling and that's just fine it's awesome I love these stories well Arcane and Snow Crash list Star Wars but this does often manifest in the head of the snake fallacy ending with killing the person at the top like Emperor Palpatine brings down the whole system when in reality I mean it just Splinter into a mess of competing factions probably equally as bad it's one of those stories that even in those Mythic revolutions right people are getting a bit tired of it and they're kind of looks like you know you didn't put in that much effort not to mention it's often connected to the if I kill you I'll be just the same as you which is I mean obviously for the most part that's a terrible false equivalency still in these stories the biggest conflicts are about uh winning battles and resisting the the urge to the dark side and and giving inspirational speeches and inspiring others and and actually accessing and controlling your full Powers those will turn the tides of the war but people love this stuff right Doctor Who has been doing optimistic science fiction for like this for decades when someone doing the right thing in the face of tyranny can turn the tides of War and these sort of stories there is a power in that stories do not need to be realistic to hold meaning and they certainly don't need to be realistic to be compelling part 4 chaos and Revolution now of course revolutions they're all about Breaking Chains of Oppression and and establishing a new free liberal order right well in theory yes in practice see we have a romanticized view of Revolution especially those of us who grew up in the why a dystopian teen love triangle everyone is divided into arbitrary category zero or fiction a hero is plucked from the messes to overthrow the oppressive regime in the name of equality Liberty and fraternity with nothing than a schlocky determination and probably a dead sister or something the reality is though a lot of revolutions tend to be a lucky Collision of a lot of different groups at the same time whose interests are compatible in bringing down the existing regime but not necessarily in what comes after especially given revolutions attract well more radical politics but that is why a lot of stories focus on what comes after the revolution George R Martin famously said A Song of Ice and Fire after Robert's Rebellion that was the righteous Rebellion against the evil King who was murdering people and there was this final Mythic showdown between our hero and antagonist on the Trident it was cinematic Robert and rhaegar but that's because George R Martin was more interested in what came after how do you reorganize Society how do you keep it from falling back into chaos revolutions naturally attract radical religious economic ethnic ideologies and when the common enemy is gone those Clash I've already mentioned Dune but ursuluguen's the dispossessed is a fantastic look at a post-revolution world anaris is this Anarchist Society founded on supposedly a quality communal living Corporation but it struggles with sustainability with forging a cohesive identity for itself with isolation and trying to realize lies these ideas and our characters are forced to choose as they experience more of the flaws of these utopian ideas looking at that Gap that can develop between the aims of the Revolution and how to get there here's the thing Revolution isn't just something that happens once and then it's done it has to keep happening to adapt and be flexible and utopian ideas often aren't Revolution is a constant process full of growing pains not a single moment and you can use that to create tension between your characters famously Katniss chooses to kill prison and coin instead of President Snow because she fears coin will become a dictator starting another Hunger Games and you know what she was right autocracy is less complex a system than democracy so it's easier for autocracies to rise out of instability than democracies PS Brown's Red Rising does similar in exploring how revolutions can be poisoned by competing interests in the various factions of a post-revolution world thousands of Augustus and the sons of Aries all have ulterior mode is leading to devastating consequences Darrow our main character has to contend with them all what does it mean to remain moral in a post-revolution world how do you keep people feared and working and deal with chaos when you're finally in charge who do you blame and how do you manage it when the war tore the country apart and destroyed so much of its infrastructure that you no longer have what you need to build the society you promised what do you do about the groups who joined the revolution but for different promises for a trade deals you took support from you know foreign interests and how do you protect the rights of people who might have been previously oppressive and how do you deal with them there are costs to war physical psychological and sometimes no Victory heals all wounds one last really interesting point is that people will idealize the past even oppressive regimes because the reality is that every regime is good for someone and often more people than you think a 2019 poll found 59 of Russians felt the Soviet Union took care of Ordinary People 66 even regretted its dissolution an undemocratic regime that repressed over a dozen surrounding countries in 2011 56 percent of lithuanians felt their standard of living had fallen since the Soviet dissolution and even though a majority in almost every country except Russia believed the Soviet Union did more harm than good elderly people really did depend on the Soviet Union's very generous pension plan they worked to it their entire lives and suddenly gone they they grew up in that culture and it was taken from them separating one's identity from a critique of how that Society might have run can be really really difficult for a lot of people this again can create conflicts between your characters in that post-revolution world where people people feel some loyalty to how things might have been even if they kind of do understand the problems with it that's a really fascinating place to take your characters psychologically how do they reconcile their connection to a place to a job to a regime with what they find out it did or the things that maybe it did but there's not enough evidence or alternatively it might genuinely be morally ambiguous as to whether the regime was bad at all what are they Justified of themselves and what do they let go of all these questions and tensions can create a really interesting story web right in your revolutionary world and the best ones always know which ones to tangle and which ones to snap let's bring all this together in a summary but first go get my book I mean if you've made it this far into the video then this is the book for you if you only want to get one of them that's okay but I say get volume two I think it has a better selection of topics but I will say volume three coming later this year is going to be the best of them all I'm really happy with how it's turning out and I'll put it out to a vote but we'll be picking between these two kind of cover Concepts before I send it off to the artist to develop it more as said these have all of the writing and word building discussions I've had and More in more detail expanded analysis and I am astounded with how well it has sold like genuinely like 80 000 copies or something I expected 500 when I first published these thank you so much from the bottom of my heart and if you want to check out my writing I recommend reading two robots at the end of the world that was published with Utopia science fiction magazine I actually have my first poetry publication coming this month I've never really tried it that much but I wanted to give it a hand and yay thank you so much if you do there are links down below keeps Channel life keeps me having some faith in myself thank you so much on to the summary firstly revolutions are only as compelling as the reasons to lead them show the reader the Injustice alienation and Desperation on a personal level second the substance of your character arcs and conflicts will color the meaning and themes of the Revolution itself thirdly realistic revolutions are drawn from a complex mix of proximate socioeconomic instability alienation collapse the social order of elite infighting and Justice and international support some are harder to dramatize but can make your story more grounded fourthly stories don't need to be realistic to be meaningful or compelling revolutions are often Mythic however this can also lead to the head of the snake problem fifthly it can be equally important to show the reasons why people don't revolt and sickly many stories focus on what happens after the revolution in fighting the struggle to realize a utopian dream and the gap between ideals and execution all of this can create a fascinating story web so if you were to create your story and lay it out kind of like this what is in the center what points of tension which characters what characters are doing right what's in the middle what connects what's out on the edges and which of these strings do you tug on most stay nerdy and I'll see you in the future who is this man what sort of devil is he to have been caught in a trap and choose to let me go free it was his hour at last to put a seal on my face Wipe Out the past and watch me clean up the Slate all it would take was a flick of his knife Vengeance was his and he gave me back my life time to fall live in the dead of a thief then if I yield at the end of the chase I am the Lord and the Lord is not mocked I am Hospitality right back in his face there is nothing on Earth that we share it is either Val Jean nor Javier how can I not allow the man how do I how can I know allow this man hold dominion over me this desperate man that I have hunted oh my gosh\n",

      "sitting the scene is kind of like moving pieces into position in a game of chess before you execute a plan Checkmate you could almost say sitting the scene is complicated we immediately jumped to describing the environment the time and place but sitting the scene is so much more than that and to understand how we're going to take a look at a ton of stories from a ton of different genres and a bunch of different writers and styles to show you how you can discomate your readers to set up that King and knock them down and we're going to start with one of the perhaps most famous scenes ever the Red [Music] Wedding part one moving pieces into position the drums were pound pounding pounding pounding and her head with them pipes wailed and flutes trilled from the musician's Gallery at the foot of the hall fiddles screeched horns blew the skin skirled in a lively tune but the drumming drove them all the sounds echoed off the rafter while the guests ate drank and shouted at one another below well de Frey must be diff as a stone to call this music Katlin sipped a cup of wine and watched Jingle Bell prance to the sounds of alisan at least she thought it was meant to be alisan with these play it might as easily have been The Bear and the Maiden fear most of the heat came off of the bodies of the wedding guests jammed in so thick along the benches that every man who tried to lift his cup poked his neighbor in the ribs if you don't know about the Red Wedding well first how and secondly I'm going to spoil it for you unless you click away from this video in 3 2 1 all right the Red Wedding is a famous scene where a king and all his army are massacred at a wedding dinner by supposed allies and look at how Martin writes this he describes the setting the musicians Gallery the rafters a place to dance the crammed benches but he's not only doing that look at the language being used here wailing trilling screeching skirling these are the sounds of people dying the last line about the heat of the bodies jabbing people in the ribs all of this could be applied to a battle scene to a massacre the song alisan that's mentioned in the passage is sad but it's being played as if it's a joyous upbeat tune to sound celebratory and happy much like a wedding which is secretly about to become a massacre all of this is foreshadowing the events of the scene to come as well as establishing an atmosphere for it it's oppressive it's crowded it's uncomfortable Martin's writing introduces the idea of death and horror without explicitly telling us creating that uncomfortable atmosphere which sets us up up for the massacre to come and these are just two of the things you can do while setting the scene outside of giving us environmental description except Martin did something else really clever here which you might have noticed when you first read this passage if you've read the books the wording here for the drums the pounding pounding and pounding it comes back later in the scene the pounding drum sets the scene as part of a musical Ensemble but they return as Drums of War whilst Catlin is liter Lally pressing a knife to someone's throat this is what we can call linguistic chiov gun where language you use while sitting the scene returns in your Pros later on with greater or a different meaning to make that twist or that reveal that move that plan that you execute hit harder these are your Bishops your poetic pieces you bring in earlier on only to bring back later with a effect in this way sitting the scene isn't just describing the setting or foreshadowing but choosing what language metaphor simile or description might Elevate the scene to come a cracked altar is just an altar until the bride leaves the ceremony in tears and suddenly a cracked altar is a lot more than that like how you might only reveal why you moved a certain piece into position once you execute your plan how you sit the scene might only reveal its full meaning once you carry out the rest of the scene I really love having these writing discussions and I'm loving this chess metaphor in case you haven't noticed I hope this makes the idea of sitting the scene a bit more interesting Dynamic but also kind of easier and applicable to your writing that's what I try to do in these videos it's actually why I've written three whole books on it and on writing and World building volume 3 is the latest one of those out now almost 100,000 copies have been sold of this series so far I I can't even begin to explain how incredible that is for me and volume 3 is the biggest and most in-depth and most exclusive in the series so far with a cover voted for by you guys these books take all of the writing and will building discussions like the one that we're having in this video and put them into these uh more easily accessible referenceable uh books with a ton more notes uh and depth than we are able to get into in the videos and in fact this this particular one has about 30,000 more words worth of analysis than I was able to do here and you might be wondering do I have to have read volumes one and two to read volume 3 and no not at all each book stands entirely on its own of course they do work together they all cover their own topics though uh I'm so excited to share this one with you this is easily the best book yet I am so happy with it and if you find videos like these today helpful then this is the next step this is what I am going to point you towards the links are down below thank you so much to the people who have already got it it's an amazing thing to be able to share this with you and you can get all three pretty cheaply together volume three in particular covers things like character descriptions subtext and dialogue uh show don't tell plot armor environmental descriptions like we referenced in this video uh anti-heroes uh we're building mountains and cities and towns all sorts of incredible stuff as links down below let's get on to more of the writing stuff part two just late now we've talked about foreshadowing and linguistic Chi off's gun but there are other pieces that you might want to move into position you've got character and tension and relationship uh and emotion and there's really no better writer to explore this than Jillian Flynn with her Incredible Book sharp objects my mother's massive house is at the southern most point of Wind Gap the wealthy section If You Can Count approximately three square blocks of a town as a section she lives in as I once did too an elaborate Victorian replete with a Widow's walk the victorians especially Southern victorians needed a lot of room to stray away from each other to duck tuberculosis and flu to avoid rapacious lust to wall themselves away from sticky emotions extra space is always good when I was a child I always walked the stairs up ran the driveway down I assumed the cigar thin rail was on the left side going up because I'm left-handed and someone thought I might like that or to think I had ever indulge in such presumptions I parked at the bottom so as to seamless intrusive wit with sweat by the time I hit the top I smelled as my mother would say ripe Jillian Flynn is just one of my favorite authors ever she has this deeply psychological writing she gets into people's minds into a character's brains in ways that other authors don't uh and that really comes out in how she sets a scene like this lines like victorians needed a lot of room to stray away from each other or parking to seem less intrusive they speak to the relationship she has with her mother that distance core to the tension of the scene to come Flynn could have described her relationship with the family cat but the scene isn't about that it's about her mother the line about how she used to think the rail was on the left because of her speaks to the mindset and emotional state of our character she used to believe she belonged in this place but no longer all of this sets the stage for the scene to come this is Flynn moving those pieces into position pieces which are relevant to the scene which will make the scene the tension the relationship as it plays out out hit bitter and hit harder when she captures this feeling of being isolated from her old home it's because that feeling is critical to the scene to come a scene will often be about a goal or a conflict or a decision or an emotional reaction or a dilemma and sitting the scene is about giving us the context to make that mean something even before we meet the mother even before the conflict starts even before a line of dialogue is utter we are already on edge from how Flynn sets her scene she grounds Us in the mindset of her character so well who is nervous and on edge and doesn't really know what to expect and so she's got all of these pieces moved into position so that she can discombobulate I can't wait for all the comments telling me about the abysmal and illegal moves I'm technically making if you look too closely at the chessboard but we can go deeper I want to show you a piece from a short story called the life and death of Lucia's library and ask what you think this scene is going to be about Lucia Vargas knew death before she knew how to walk death lived in a book at the top of their family library on the second floor its cover of pressed feathers plucked from the loose scraps of her cloak and its spine sealed with candle wax left in her footsteps it had always kept her close to the family inside a Nephilim tree Grew From Page to page each branch a different member of see his family going back countless Generations as a child she always feared would run out of pages but Ma assured her never had never would never could death don't run out and neither do we she said if you guess the scene involves someone dying you'd be right Lucia's grandmother is found in her bed mouth a gape shoes covered in drool and puke and this is actually one of my stories and I want to show you which pieces I was moving into position and why and let me know what you picked up on we immediately get Lucia's complex and intimate relationship with death while the scene itself is about those different relationships others in her family can have with death they're obsessed with it or fearful of it running from it the line death don't run out brings in that tension it is always coming for them and they learn to live with it the book itself is critical to the scene because it's how Lucia discovers her grandmother is is dead she sees that Branch taper off in the book I wanted to introduce all these pieces so that when the grandmother dies we left with the sense of inevitability that kind of numbs the loss and sets up the story to come where many more people will die and yet Lucia lives through it and even though herar shes her neither do we we very quickly see this family is dwindling the story as a whole is about the different ways we engage with death and all of this is way more important than the fact that there's a library which would be setting the scene giving us the setting but it's not what the scenes really about and there are two parts to this right there's the setting and the scene and if you want to read more of this story then do go get my book a catalog for the end of humanity which as I say on the back these are stories about death endings and finding hope somewhere in between this is the most personal thing that I have ever written and I'd love to share it with you it's got a ton of my professionally published fiction which I'm really proud of but also a ton of original exclusive stories like the life and death of Lucia's library writing is who I am on a core level and I can finally share this with you this is also the most direct way that you can actually support me personally I put everything I talk about in these videos into practice in my own writing and that is why I am so confident in this book again links down below you know thank you everybody who gets my books but especially this one because this is just so personal to me another way to imagine scenes is as shifts in emotions or belief like Catlin Stark begins one way and ends up another in this case uh bleeding out and extremely sad her son is dead but you're setting the scene by establishing where that change is going to come from moving that PE in hence why Flynn writes so much about that Family dynamic in sharp objects the character starts the scene nervous and she ends up leaving it tired and frustrated with her family a character might have a lot of emotions about a lot of different things but you've got to be conscious of bringing the right emotions to the Forefront of the readers mind to set them up for where that shift is going to come from but let's talk about a more tangible thing part three shikov actual gun on a more structural level scene setting includes establishing important set pieces objects environmental obstacles which will become relevant later in the scene in the Red Wedding it's important to establish the rafters because that's where the massacre comes from in the Phantom of the Opera they very much establish the giant chandelier because later on it falls down if doors suddenly start appearing where the reader didn't know they were and the characters can escape through them or they end up using conveniently placed guns on the walls it can feel a little too much like a wizard did it you want to introduce or at least imply things which would be unexpected in your setting or at least important for how the scene will play out especially if characters benefit from it it matter is less if they're put at disadvantage because a sudden trap appears but if they're in a classroom we probably expect chairs and windows right but if they're in a bank vault tell us about the weird crack in the wall that they might be able to exploit later and this applies more broadly by the way to the te ion character relationships and emotions which are going to come up in the scene later on as see characters are feeling a lot of different stuff in any given scene but only some of it's going to be relevant to this particular scene and they're the pieces that you're probably going to want to move into position more like how Flynn focuses on that family dynamic or when Martin is writing about catlin's emotional state at the start of the scene you get the impression she's a little bit apart from the ceremony and and festivities that are going on she's not quite as absorbed in the Affairs of the wedding as others and that does set up how she eventually notices the massacre right before it's about to happen she recognizes the Reigns of castamir which is the signal for the massacre of course I'm not saying you want to Telegraph what's going to happen in your scene this is something to keep in mind when editing perhaps am I building up to the point of the scene is my introspection and my focus in the right place could the tension or pacing be elevated by setting the scene through the lens of a different relationship or perspective or emotion all of this is about keeping the intent of the scene in mind when you're setting it just like moving pieces throughout the board is going to change where the conflict is happening where will this scene guide The Narrative where will it shift the relationship that the reader has with the story so that's one way of thinking about your scene but another one is part four questions and answers you are asking questions when you see at the scene will this happen what will happen if x will they manage to why and you give answers in playing the scene out for an example let's take a look at this passage from Rebecca Campbell's an important failure a story about a guy who spends much of his life working on a violin for a woman he has known since she was a little girl even from his bed even on oxygen Edy was critical when Mason brought it upstairs examining it with an eyeglass until he conceded the sound was as fine in its own way as any number of other violins he had seen finer even than the Composites he' started to use for his own work when he could work chorine and carbon fiber you made something kid it had been a long time since anyone called him kid even Eddie does it have a name idy asked does it need one if it had to be named it should have been something elegant and sorous this passage is given at the beginning of the scene before we actually meet the woman that he's going to give the violin 2 which is the intention of the scene this is him giving this thing that he's been working on for his entire life and in sitting the scene Campbell introduces a blatant question does the violin have a name and in the scene it gets one npin Campbell asks this question and sitting the scene and answers it but this question is also symbolically important npen was a fictional medicine for sorrow a drug of forgetfulness and by this point in the story the woman has kind of forgotten the joy that playing the violin ever brought her when she was younger but scen sitting questions are rarely so literal I've been really enjoying Savannah Brown's the things we don't see where we get this little line of introspection when describing the environment of the small town Island beside me there's a lighthouse a colossal thing floating towards it happens naturally a moth drawn to the flame and I want to go in this line immediately BS the question what's in the lighthouse I want to know you want to go in I want to go in and the conflict of this scene is that a police officer comes along and warns her to stay away and takes her away from the lighthouse and you kind of oh go no I want to go in you know that you'll return there because more importantly this establishes the importance of the lighthouse in the story more broadly too often we get caught up in just describing stuff things that are just there characters arrive in a place and we give them a big laundry list of stuff which happens to be around them and then we go on and just do the scene of what happens there but that's kind of like moving random pieces into position and then trying to execute a plan with whatever pieces we happen to have right it doesn't work it's a scattershot I can't take down the king with these random pieces it might tell us where we are but it doesn't lay a strong foundation for the plan and scene to come what all of these stories have in common is that they're very conscious of the story that they're trying to tell within the scene that they're setting however you've also got to think about the place of the one scene and two elements inside the scene within the broader narrative as a whole because sometimes there are elements which might not be hugely relevant to the actual scene at hand but are going to be relevant to later scenes later on and to explain what I mean we're going to look at the opening scenes to Brandon sanderson's recent book Yumi and the nightmare painter Yumi had always considered the appearance of the day star to be encouraging an omen of Fortune it seemed extra bright today glowing a soft blue on the western Horizon as the sun rose in the East a powerful sign if you believed such things the day star itself isn't actually that important for the scene at hand it's not the subject of tension or a relationship or the intention of the scene really but the point of this book is how it parallels the stories of two characters they sort of end up swapping lives sort of your name style if you've seen that and in the first chapter of the other character we also get this the star was particularly bright when the nightmare painter starts at as rounds the star singular no not a sun just one star a bullet hole in the midnight sky bleeding pale light again it's not all that important for the scene at hand but the wider parallel it creates between these two characters and their important differences are Central to the overall story just in this little flash we can see how they think differently about the star Yumi sees it as a sign of Hope painter describes it with imagery of death a bullet hole bleeding right from the start we get the impression that these two are on the the same journey in a sense they're facing the same problem they see the same things though in different ways and it's also an important set piece for the story kind of like the chandelier in Phantom of the Opera it will come back later you're going to have a lot of symbols in your story which appear in one scene but don't necessarily become relevant till a lot later on so spending words on them in that case when you're sitting the scene is still worth it this also applies by the way to that linguistic chick off's gun we spoke spoke about before language which you introduce at one point to become more relevant more meaningful different later on even if it's not in this scene and this is by the way more common at the start of books where you're introducing the characters and establishing the world a bit more like with Yumi here but it applies where any given scene has an important especially symbolic role to play in The Wider story feeding into those connections to other events characters and stories which knits the whole narrative together and we really see that in Yi and the nightmare painter his scene sitting there is about the wider parallel in the narrative than about the individual scene that we actually see that in now you're probably wondering we're talking about sitting the scene why AR we talking about environmental descriptions and we will in a bit but I really want to drive home that scene setting is often a lot more dependent on introspection than on time and place and physical setting and we've seen that in the examples we' have discussed in the life and death Lucia's library in Sharp objects in uh an important failure uh in Yi and the nightmare painter and that's because the environment is almost always filtered through the lens of a particular character and the introspection is often a lot closer to what the actual story is really going to be about the stuff that gets us grounded in this world and scene sitting is often pretty introspective because we can sometimes presume where a scene is taking place because it it might have been established earlier on in the story or because it's licit in other details it doesn't really require much description however it is still inescapable I'm not trying to step around it that a huge part of sitting the scene is part six environmental descriptions now I have done not only a whole video on environmental descriptions before but there's a whole chapter on it in this book with a ton of more notes and detail so if you really want to dig into that quite fundamental part of writing get this book and read that chapter but I want to narrow in on some details around sitting the scene specifically the first being set it with an active character halfway down the trailer Elena slips into the woods behind a fallen Larch tree wit clusters of tissue Market as a common detour steaming urine splashes against the back of her carves and pools in the Moss under her Runners before sinking away I'm sorry for such a visceral description but having your characters do something with their environment engaging with it sets the scene off at a pace while helping you establish the setting the character here is interacting with specific details they're moving through the woods looking for somewhere to go to the bathroom so we get the woods and the Fallen trees the tissues the Moss before we launch into the core of the scene and more importantly we'll discover later on in this scene there's this strange mucus in the forest they describe it as quote thick gloopy and wet a star jelly so already start starting with bodily functions like this kind of fits the theme it introduces and seeds that idea to foreshadow what's to come having your character do something avoids your scene setting from feeling static like you're putting the whole story on pause so that you can quickly describe the setting before moving on calling it to a grinding halt it immediately sets your character up to discover something or to be interrupted or to uh pursue something all of which are a lot more interesting than just having a stat setting if they're in a market describe the characters perusing the goods if they're in a rural town have them driving through the empty abandoned streets full of rundown dilapidated houses but and this is something a lot of people miss an active opening to the scene isn't limited to a character physically interacting with their surrounding it often helps but introspection can give Pace to a scene too the examples from Flynn's writing and Brown's writing do exactly that internalizing what they're seeing and that internalization actually moves the story forward it develops our expectations for the scene our relationship with the character with the setting it's what I'm going to call psychological movement as opposed to physical movement in setting the scene and it's just as important but scene setting is also about the atmosphere The Vibes you might say I mean that's what it is right and a lot of this is going to come down to your word choice and which details you include let me explain when we spoke before about the Red Wedding feeling claustrophobic and joyless that's the Vibes that's the atmosphere we're meant to feel that in the scene it's the character of the physical setting if we return to Flynn's writing she could have described anything about this house but she deliberately chooses details which make the emisphere feel isolating unwelcoming alienating the huge amount of space compared ing the people to tuberculosis the southernmost point her word choice is intentional the rail is not Slender but thin it is not a Candlestick but a cigar a poisonous object of addiction like this house is full of disease The Vibes of this place are all off it might be true that there is a beautiful garden full of lively and colorful birds a whole place full of life and wonder and color but narrowing in on those details when setting the scene for this house would have given us the wrong atmosphere the wrong Vibes but that's because and this is the key point so much of environmental description isn't about just giving us details about the physical setting but about what the place feels like and so you've got to be deliberate in crafting that what happens in the scene might change how you want it to feel if your characters are about to get mugged in the middle of the night then a for boing and Grim atmosphere sits the stage for that tension you're going to describe the flickering neon lights and The Echoes of movement and the Shadows alternatively you might give atmosphere to create contrast with whatever is going to happen listen to the environmental description Katherine Patterson gives us in the scene right before she reveals Leslie is dead in Bridge to Terabithia when they came out of the building it was into brilliant spring Sunshine the wistern sun danced on the windshield dazzling his eyes it's hopeful it's bright it's happy it's a great time right this is a nice atmosphere to be in all to make that sudden reveal so much darker you can also use atmosphere to establish character right like most people would feel unsafe in a dark Alle way at night but you might describe them as skipping through the shadowed uh narrow alleys Moonlight peeking through the clouds and what what does that give us What atmosphere is that this tells us that the character feels pretty at home out here that it is not a creepy atmosphere for them maybe they grew up on the street or they're a vigilante who was born in the dark molded by it and they did not see light until they were already a man the atmosphere changes with the perspective character again we see that in Flynn's work right because they have a different experience over the place and the other most important tip in writing environmental descriptions and this kind of applies to most can descriptions and most of writing I've discussed it before you've heard me say it and I'm going to say it again say it with me specificity specific details are almost always more grounding immersive and effective than generalizations in my story the life and death of Lucia's Library I didn't just describe a dark book but one with a cover of pressed feathers plucked from the loose scraps of death's cloak Flynn doesn't just describe an old large Victorian house but one full of cubby holes and Nooks curiously circuitous specificity allows you to craft the feeling experience atmosphere of a place an object a person that you want right and when each scene has a specific intention you got to keep that in mind when you're setting it a last thing to keep in mind is proportionate scene sitting this is a problem I've seen a lot you know some scenes are short and relatively inconsequential and that's okay you know they don't need a lot of scene setting or environmental description in that case but I've seen this a lot before imagine the characters pull up at a Lakeside for one night and the author goes on to give this beautiful elaborate three paragraph long description about how the frogs jump from lily pad to Lily Pad and the soft dusk fog scatters the last of the sunlight but then the characters don't do anything there they just kind of go to sleep and that was meant to tell us where they are it's that compulsion to describe whatever happens to be around our characters that idea that we must know exactly what's around them at all times that drives people to do this you've got to make sure you read and knows but it's again kind of like moving all these pieces into position but then doing nothing with it executing no plan of course maybe it's just your style and that's okay if you want to describe the lily pads and the fog because you like lily pads and it's your book it's up to you but you do got to keep in mind kind of which scenes matter and how much description scene setting you really need for them and also remember that your readers can imagine a lot often better than we can ever describe it and inviting them into the process where they're allowed to imagine and impose their kind of vision for the world uh on your book that can be really useful and you can learn how to utilize that and if you want more detail pick up on running World building volume 3 uh it is really where all the goodies are stored but let's bring all of this into a summary first seting the scene is like moving pieces into position in a game of chess these pieces are tension relationship objects character and emotion all to make the scene hit home secondly look for how you can foreshadow your scene in setting it consider using the linguistic chick off's gun to bring language used earlier on back into the scene with new or greater meaning thirdly establish important objects set pieces and other things which will give your characters an advantage in the scene fourthly scenes can be understood as questions and answers what questions do you ask ining the scene these
